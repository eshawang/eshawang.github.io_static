Hi, and welcome to my blog about food, travels, photography, and other hobbies. A little bit about myself - I currently work as a data scientist at Hartford Steam Boiler doing statistical work for equipment breakdown analysis. Previously, I was an AI/ML research scientist at Nokia Bell Labs, where I studied novel applications for deep learning in 6G. I consider myself to be a technical person with a creative brain, so I use this space as my creative outlet when I am not running models day to day. This blog is meant to be an archive of my thoughts and anecdotes, sprinkled with some artistic work and mathematical musings, and to bring shape to otherwise ephemeral experiences. Enjoy your stay, fellow trooper!
