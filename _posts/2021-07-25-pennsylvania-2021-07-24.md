## July 24, 2021 - July 25, 2021

E + K planned a trip to Philadelphia for the weekend to meet Relyx + Angela. Our first stop on Saturday was lunch at Reading Terminal Market, where K got his first authentic Philly cheese steak from Spataro’s and E ordered jambalaya and po’ boy from Beck’s Cajun Café.

Then, we walked to Kung Fu Tea to get Relyx his first boba(!) and to combat the heat - we got large strawberry lemonade with aloe and mango slush with mango popping bubbles for ourselves.

With iced drinks in hand, we headed to Philadelphia’s Historic District and visited Carpenter’s Hall, Independence Hall (just the outside since there were no more tours), and the Liberty Bell (just the outside since the line was too long).

We took a small break at Independence Beer Garden, where E got a Frank the Tank cocktail which K actually thought was ok for once.

After resting a while and talking about games and work and rectangles, the four of us continued to Benjamin Franklin’s grave, which someone commented was adorned with the wrong president’s face (he forgot Franklin wasn’t a president), and Franklin Square (where we did not play mini-golf).

From there, we went to check in to our hotel in Old City before we met back up for dinner at Hajimaru Fishtown, where we ordered our first takoyaki in a while, a signature ramen, and curry karrage chicken don.

Finally, we all headed to Barcade to play some older school video games. E + K got carried in TMNT, shot some poor terrorists in Gunblade, and then E watched K race against Relyx and some mean CPUs in Daytona (still won though). Before heading to bed, we got some cool shots of the lit up Benjamin Franklin Bridge (yeah, we get it Philly).

For breakfast on Sunday, we went to Eggcellent Café, where we got Sunrise Sammies and Green Goddess sandwiches with a Berrylicious smoothie. We took a stroll around the Irish Memorial at Penn’s Landing and walked along the pier before heading back home. Later for dinner, E was craving dumplings, so we tried East Flour in JC, which turned out to be pretty good (though still not as value as Joe’s Shanghai).
