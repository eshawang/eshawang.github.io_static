## May 25, 2021 - June 1, 2021

After spending many months at home working, cooking, and playing FFXIV, E + K finally got vaccinated and visited Norcal to see friends and K’s family for the first time since moving to NJ a year ago. Shirley and K’s parents picked us up from SFO, and we got to see the new house in Milpitas. It was very cute with many flowers and fruit trees (lemon, peach, and dragonfruit) in the backyard and a great view of the mountains around Fremont.

We enjoyed some yummy homecooking from K’s parents and then drove to see the sunset at Sierra Vista Point. We were super lucky, as we happened to catch the full moon rising as well, and there was a crowd of photographers gathered for it. Also, we saw some cows.

The next day, E had some morning meetings, while K played with M&M and helped with putting up new pictures on the wall and some IT work for the fam. We all got dim sum from Mayflower Seafood Restaurant (good food is so plentiful in Milpitas) and boba and popcorn chicken (of course) from T4, then went to play mini golf AKA 18 volcano holes. For dinner, K met up with PV + J (:joy:) at Mantra India in MV. 

Early Thursday morning (at least we were still on east coast time), K got up to hike Mission Peak with his dad. K was very popular with his dad’s friends, and they climbed to the top with a solid time of 1h20m.

For lunch, we had Xi’an Kitchen by recommendation of Cissto, and we carb overloaded with chili oil noodles, liang pi, and roujiamo.

Cissto picked us up later in the evening, and we all went to Valley Fair for some food and shopping. K got a light jacket from Zara, E acquired six(!) items, and Cissto got some skincare recommendations by E from Sephora. After filling our cravings for Chicken Wow and Somi Somi, we all drove to Cissto’s apartment in Monterey.

K started the next day enjoying the ocean air from the deck and looking for his namesake bird, while eating a healthy breakfast of milk and :butterfinger:. Once everyone was up, we bought California Chicken sandwiches and K’s favorite Hawaiian kettle chips from 3 Mundos. We then hit the road to Big Sur, with background music from Terry:D. E found a pretty field of flowers and hill to climb, with a DST resurrection stone at the top.

K somehow forgot about Bixby Creek Bridge and McWay (Make Way “musical_note:) Falls from our previous trip but remembered the gas station and Nepenthe, where we ate again with a great view of the sea. Back in Monterey, we walked along the beach and pointed out the cute names for all the expensive houses we passed by. Then we strolled along the shops at Carmel-by-the-Sea. E + K bought some gummies and Turkish delights and looked at a photo gallery, antiques shop, and stationary store. We stopped by Cafe Carmel to rest our feet before Cissto’s dinner reservation. For dinner, we treated Cissto to Carmel’s Bistro Giovanni, where K ordered ravioli with prosciutto and E got the pasta piccata with chicken, and we all shared a tiramisu for dessert.

Afterwards, Cissto taught E about ice wine, and we relaxed for the rest of the night with some video games. Froto signed on simultaneously to play some Frontline, thoroughly confusing Maeve, and then E + K watched Cissto try We Were Here. “Unfortunately”, Ulto picked librarian and had to deal with colored charts and books, while Ciss picked explorer and got lost. 

Saturday morning, Ulto picked up bagels, and we headed back to SJ for the first Dream Norcal meetup with Yuera and Hoid. We started with lunch at Starbird near E’s old Magnolia apartment (why wasn’t it around when we lived there?). In classic TC fashion, our WHM went to the wrong position to pick up our PLD, and Froto subbed in to grab him. After lunch, we visited TDC and hung out with Lauren and the new cats. K spent nearly 15 minutes lying on the floor to pet Kai underneath the storage shelves and also had a lot of fun feeding Ghost a Churu treat in his blanket fort. Carmel was the star of the show and attracted pets from everyone.

Cissto found  Buttercup to match B&B, but unfortunately she was already set to be adopted. All too soon, the kitty session was over, so we headed to Teaspoon for some boba. We then decided to go for mini golf round 2, picking up Ath along the way. We ended the day with dinner at Shanghai Family Restaurant and got unexpected front row seats to a smash and grab, further solidifying K’s mantra to never take a nice car to Cupertino Village. 

Sunday was a chill day of sleeping in, homecooked meals, and hanging out with Techers. We went on a walk with K’s parents around Sandy Wool lake and got some nice modeling shots. 

Photo dump incoming.

On Monday, K’s extended family came over for a housewarming BBQ, and they played a lot of Mahjong. K’s aunt played very well and, combined with an amazing streak of luck, decimated everyone else’s chip stacks. Meanwhile, meat was consumed, a lawn chair was broken, and E’s guacamole was sorely missed.

Finally, on Tuesday morning, E + K flew back to NJ, but not without a last meal of all of E’s favorite dishes from TPK.
