## December 12, 2022

On Monday, Janet flew to the east coast for work, and planned to meet up with Esha and Kelvin for dessert in Edison. After the work day was over, we first drove to US-1 Authentic Shanghai Dumpling in Edison for dinner, recommended by one of Esha’s coworkers. It was a relatively small place, so we had to wait about 20 minutes before getting seated. In the meantime, we stopped by a nearby Gong Cha and got some Lemon Aiyu with White Pearl. Eventually, we got seated at the restaurant, and had the most difficult time deciding what to order since everything looked so good. In the end we opted for the chive pocket to start, followed by some crab and pork xiao long bao, Shanghai cu chao mien, and finally some sticky rice shumai. The xiao long bao actually were not spectacular, but we both thoroughly enjoyed the chive pocket and chao mien. The sticky rice shumai was definitely the most unique item and we thoroughly enjoyed that as well, although we were reaching our stomach capacity and definitely struggled to eat them by the time they came out.

We had some time to kill before dessert, so we stopped by an HMart for Esha to stock up on some groceries since Kelvin was supposed to fly out to Austin the next day. Afterwards, we walked over to Mango Mango and got a table, while Janet met up with us soon afterwards. We ordered our go-to mango pancake and Janet requested the Mo Mo Cha Cha, which turned out to be a hot soup made with possibly taro and sago. Both tasted great, and the three of us shared the desserts while Esha and Janet complained about coworkers. After dessert, Janet handed us Christmas/Kelvin’s birthday gifts! We got a cute board game and Kelvin got a pair of oven mitts to replace the ones that gave him second degree burns last time. Eventually, we drove back to Jersey City feeling super stuffed and super grateful as we looked forward to our upcoming holiday adventures.
