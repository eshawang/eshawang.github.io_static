## July 17, 2021 - July 18, 2021

E + K started their Saturday with a morning swim at the pool, then headed to Smorgasburg in Jersey City to offset the brutal calorie loss.

We started with a Classico and spinach fried risotto balls from The Little Sicilian, then ordered a box of jerk chicken from Jerkin Chicken (yes, very original).

While waiting for the food, it began to pour so K had to trek back to the car for an umbrella to protect E’s bag. To cool off from the warm rain (just east coast things), we got watermelon and cucumber & lime popsicles from La Newyorkina, and we ended our food festival experience with Destination Dumplings.

After changing out of our soaked-through clothes, we headed to the mall, where E had a great time dressing up K. We went home with a big haul of new jeans, shorts, and polos. Inspired by the overpriced popsicles from earlier, E bought a mold for DIY juice pops. For dinner, we (mostly E) made a delicious seafood paella with leftovers from the fridge to eat while watching Downton Abbey.

For lunch on Sunday, we took the train to 33rd street and tried BCD Tofu House in KTown. The sides and seafood pancake were delicious (we each got a whole fried fish!), and K stuffed himself to the breaking point with 150% rice and sides portions.

To ease K’s digestion, we walked to Bryant Park afterwards, where K promptly plopped on the grass and rolled around in pain.

As it started looking like rain again, we headed into a Nordstrom Rack, where we continued our shopping spree from the day before with a pair of shoes and dress pants for the upcoming wedding season. Finally, E + K went back to KTown for X.O.X.O. shaved snow from Grace Street.
