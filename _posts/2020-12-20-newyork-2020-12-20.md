E + K visited Danielle + Andrew in their new apartment in Dumbo, Brooklyn. We ordered delivery from Win Son. Then we took a walk, snapping a classic picture of the Brooklyn bridge.

We stopped by One Girl Cookies for some very cutely named desserts (there was one named Danielle). Then we took the short ferry ride across the East River to Seaport. After a long walk, we ended up at SoHo and shopped at The RealReal for the first time. E found a Gucci coat for K, which is now the most expensive item in his wardrobe by 6dB.
