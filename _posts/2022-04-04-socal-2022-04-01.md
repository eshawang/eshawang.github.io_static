## April 1, 2022 - April 4, 2022

On Friday night, E and K took the long flight from the east coast to LAX. K mostly slept along the way, while E stayed up to study for an interview coming up the following week. When we finally landed, and following an unfortunate series of circumstances, such as the shuttle taking forever, getting the rental car line moving at a snail’s pace, and technical difficulties that delayed us leaving with the rental car, we arrived at Seorim and Daniel’s home at around 1:30am California time. By that time, E felt like a zombie, and promptly passed out and fell into a deep slumber.

The next morning, E had to wake up early for Phoebe’s bachelorette party. K offered to drop off E and Dohee at the party, so Dohee stopped by where we were staying first. The bachelorette party was located at a park in San Pedro, and after another one of E’s “where is my phone” incidents, E and Dohee successfully met up with Lydia and Johanna and settled on a location for the picnic and backdrop. Danielle and Vivian joined us soon after, who helped out with constructing the backdrop and blowing up NSFW balloons. Lydia taught E how to set up a charcuterie board, which ended up looking both colorful and delicious. All too soon, Phoebe arrived with Charlotte before we completed setting up, and in true Phoebe fashion, she asked how she could help out. The rest of us were very insistent that she just go take a walk, but we ended up just talking and catching up a bit, since it had been a while since Phoebe had seen some of us.


After setting up the picnic area, we all had a delicious meal consisting of cheese, crackers, Godiva, and champagne. Vivian told us about her brave little two year old, Danielle talked about work, New York, and some drama about one of her old friends, E talked about not wanting to move to Austin, while poor Charlotte had to be around suggestive balloons about her brother. Lydia planned a few games, such as guessing Leon’s answer to specific questions. For another one, we each wrote down our favorite memory with Phoebe, and she had to guess who wrote it. E’s was fairly obvious, since “where is my phone” incidents can easily be extended to “where is literally anything, including a borrowed bracelet” incidents. After that, it was time for Phoebe to open gifts! She got several pieces of lingerie, some workout clothes, and an Aesop gift set. E gifted a picture frame from MUJI, along with some of the engagement photos she edited and printed out. Afterwards, E set up a self timer on her DSLR, and we had everyone stand in front of the backdrop to take pictures. We started off with the bride-to-be with each of the girls doing silly poses and making jokes. E attempted her best to do what photographers are supposed to do best, which is make their subjects comfortable and get them talking, making for some of the best candid shots. Phoebe and Lydia make the cutest sister pair. We also got a shot with everyone at the end, and props to Vivian for the carry (literally).

Since Phoebe and Lydia had a family dinner to attend in the evening, we only had about two hours to head over and enjoy a nearby Korean spa. E had never been to one before, but she tried to act cool about it, and thinks she pulled it off pretty well! Since we did not have too much time to spare, we just sat around and talked in the hot tubs, but next time, E definitely wants to get a full body scrub. E, Dohee, and Danielle had a nice talk about moving, career, and relationships, which was refreshing since E felt like we all share a similar outlook, despite not having kept in touch all that well recently. After the hot tub was starting to get a bit too steamy, we went to the food court area to order some lunch. E got a salmon teriyaki, which looked like the least carb option. Dohee and Danielle both ordered a cold soba noodle, which looked great as well. Phoebe and Lydia laughed and talked about their family dynamic, recalling stories of their parents being the textbook definition of loyalist, their uncle who really likes having meals with them, and Phoebe and Leon’s trip across Asia seeing both sides of the family and seeing all the sights. 

Soon after, it was time to part ways. Phoebe dropped off E and Dohee and their hotel in Torrance (thanks Jonathan), which was located at a convenient location right across from the mall. Dohee needed to get some complexion products, and E was excited to offer her VIB Rouge discount. Dohee ended up getting a Rare Beauty concealer and E got the NEST Seville Orange perfume oil that she had been eyeing for a while. We also stopped by a Mitsuwa, where E bought some mochi donuts and Fugetsu-do. Dohee ordered a mozzarella dog from Oh K-Dog, which E had a bite of and was quite tasty. E also ordered the new Teaspoon guava drink called Guava Sunset, which is described as a fresh blended guava and pineapple marmalade with a splash of lemon juice. Probably one of E’s favorite drinks from Teaspoon thus far! We also stopped by a lululemon, which E found to be as overpriced as she originally thought. After our short mall excursion, we went back to the hotel to relax for the rest of the night. Dohee asked E if there was anything she wanted to watch on the TV, and E shamelessly took the opportunity to introduce her to Heaven Official’s Blessing on Netflix. Mama Maeve would be so proud. With a face mask and lip mask, E and Dohee watched all the way until the end of the ghost bridegroom arc before E was ready to pass out before the wedding tomorrow. 

E and Dohee woke up early to get ready for the big day, but after our morning routine of Starbucks, doing our makeup and hair, and changing into our bridesmaid dresses, we ended up having to rush to our Uber to get to the venue. Luckily, we still got there with plenty of time to spare before the dress rehearsal. When we arrived, we said hello to Leon and Phoebe’s dad, and all the bridesmaids hung out for a bit in the bridesmaids room while K and Andrew went on a little joy ride in the latter’s rental Porsche. The dress rehearsal itself was relatively straightforward. Despite it being LA, the morning air was brisk and slightly chilly. E was paired with one of Leon’s groomsmen, and also in classic E manner, did not make a point to remember his name or anything else about him. Afterwards, Phoebe, Lydia, and their mom arrived from their professional hair and makeup session. Phoebe changed into her chicken cutlets and wedding dress, and the photographer took a variety of cute and silly pictures, including nostril flaring, farts, and a recreation of a scene from The Ring. The photographer was quite receptive to all of Phoebe’s (and E’s) crazy ideas, and we all had a pretty good laugh about it. After eating some tasty hors d'oeuvres, the guests were all seated, and we were ready to start the ceremony. Lydia walked first, followed by Johanna and then E. When E walked to the front, she saw that poor Leon was already sobbing, his eyes beet red. Seeing all the guests in one spot, E observed that the wedding was actually fairly small. It gave off a very intimate and familial feeling, which E appreciated. After the bridesmaids and groomsmen were in place, the guests all stood as Phoebe and her parents walked down the aisle. The ceremony itself was rather short, officiated by none other than Phoebe’s dad. We all had a good laugh when he accidentally called Leon by Lydia’s husband’s name instead. Phoebe and Leon then exchanged vows, with Leon’s vow starting off with “I am not a smart man”, as all good speeches do. Jokes were made and tears were shed, but all too soon, the ceremony was over. E and Dohee helped decorate the wedding cake from the altar flower arrangement while Phoebe and Leon went to take some more pictures with their photographer. Afterwards, the bridal party gathered to prepare an entrance and a little dance before lunch. To E’s horror, she and her partner were to go first. E ended up flailing her arms and spinning in circles, but managed to make it to her seat without being too much of an embarrassment. Lunch consisted of salad, truffle mac and cheese, pizza, steak, and desserts, which were quite delicious. After our meal, people started to slowly gather in the middle for some midday drinking and dancing. One of the guests had a little boy who was killing it on the dance floor, and he was definitely living for the attention xD. At some point, Andrew let K borrow the keys to his rental Porsche, and E and K ended up going for a short ride around the area. Eventually the reception came to an end and it was time to part ways. E and K first dropped off Dohee at her friend’s place and then drove back to Seorim’s house where they took a much needed nap. Later that evening, Natalie came over and we got Thai food for takeout. The restaurant had a pork belly pad thai was particularly delicious. Over dinner, we talked about horror movies, bees, and Natalie’s driving awareness, almost all in the form of Seorim and Daniel’s bickering. Eventually E and K couldn’t take it anymore and food coma’d to sleep.

On Monday, E and K set out for their old stomping grounds, the 626. We drove from Inglewood to Arcadia, which took a little under an hour, to get lunch at the long-awaited Dumpling House. The ordering was quick and ambitious, and we were soon greeted with a table spread of two orders of pork, shrimp, and chives dumplings, two pork rolls, a string bean with black bean sauce, and a cold pork belly in garlic chili oil. We belabored the secret behind making such delicious dumplings while thoroughly enjoying every bite, and still couldn’t figure out how the texture and pork flavor were done so perfectly. The side dishes of string bean and pork belly were also great in their own right, and we both found the cut of pork to be better than what we had at Szechuan Mountain House. Unfortunately, K pushed E a little too hard in finishing all the dumplings, so we took the pork rolls to go back home. Even then, E groaned and stumbled in pain all the way down the three blocks to Half & Half Tea Express. From Half & Half we ordered K’s default ice milk drink with all the toppings, a lavender milk tea for E, and an ice milk drink and normal milk tea for Seorim and Daniel. There was some confusion as to which drink was whose when we got them since they were unlabeled, but luckily K guessed the right ones. With boba in hand, we headed to Tech for a short walk down memory lane. We parked on San Pasqual and went down the Olive Walk, up by the Turtle Pond, and sat on the bridge in front of the library for a while. We noticed a lot of younger-than-usual students walking around and discovered that it happened to be Prefrosh Weekend for the class of 2025 *shudder*. Continuing on, we passed by the Wedding Cake, Moore, Annenberg, Avery, and Sloan, and then turned up the street to see a new AWS quantum computing building that looked very swanky. After our short tour, we went back to Inglewood to drop off the boba orders and say goodbye to Seorim and Daniel, then we headed to a beer garden called Father’s Office to get dinner with Phoebe, Dohee, and Danielle and Andrew (and Cici!) before we flew out. E got carded for the first time in a while, but then we enjoyed a nice night of catching up on everyone’s careers and travels, and of course congratulating Phoebe on her wedding.
