On Friday, E + K met up with PJ + Iris in NYC. We visited Little Island near Chelsea, where we drank very unsweetened lemonade, watched an improv group, and laughed at New Yorkers taking pictures of the NJ skyline.

Afterwards, Iris left to hang out with her friends and attend a Zedd concert, while the rest of us walked over to L’Accolade for dinner. We ordered a beet salad, duck, gnocchi, and sea bass to share.

All the entrées were delicious, but it seemed all three of us were not quite full, as we went straight to Flip Sigi upon leaving the restaurant. We introduced PJ to the east coast Cali burrito, and K was giddy to try an Ube Rainbowdoodle.

Finally satisfied, we went back home so K could kill people in Onsal :cropping:.
