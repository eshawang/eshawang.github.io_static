## May 9, 2022 - May 15, 2022

Kelvin arrived in Kona after finishing book 2 of TGCF. Shir and Joelanda grabbed him from the airport where he was already suffering the blast of Hawaii summer humidity. Expecting lush greenery, they instead drove past lots and lots of lava rock on the way to Punalu’u Black Sand Beach. They found some napping sea turtles, tiny mollusks, and a crab or two (besides Joelanda). Joel picked up a wild coconut and began to crack it on the rocks, and a random lady told them they were bad and wrong. Regardless, the coconut was cracked, but then ants crawled out of it and Kelvin yeeted it into the ocean. Next, they drove to Hawaii Volcanoes National Park. They saw some steam vents and sulfur banks from a nice boardwalk (no leg burns ty) and walked around Kīlauea crater. After dinner at Thai Thai Bistro, they attempted to see the lava flow but were turned away due to too many visitors. Back at the Airbnb, Joel prepared some sapote, but Kelvin found it mostly tasteless and 3/10 texture, would not recommend.

The next morning, Kelvin, Joel, and Shir (Amanda unfortunately had to work) got breakfast at The Coffee Shack, which was one of Kelvin’s favorite meals of the trip. He ordered an ono benedict, which lived up to its (Hawaiian, not English) name, and a lilikoi cheesecake. While the guys ate, they enjoyed a scenic view of a private farm over the ocean and saw avocado trees and a couple of geckos on the railing. Afterwards, they drove to the City of Refuge, better known as Pu’uhonoa O Honaunau, where Joel continued his search for an ant-less coconut as they toured the religious grounds, and Kelvin got a close up video of a cute gecko on a noni aka “stinky cheese” fruit. Throughout the historical park, they learned about Chief Ali’i, wearing a cheese, resting on lava…owns all these pools, how’s he stay cool? With canopies! They also watched a very dramatic movie about the sanctuary, learning the custom of throwing a spear at visiting chiefs before negotiations and all of the horrendous crimes deserving of capital punishment, like casting a shadow or co-ed eating. After finishing their walk around the City, the guys picked up Amanda and went to Da Poke Shack for lunch, which had rave reviews from Shirley and other friends. While it was certainly a unique take on poke, being much more sauce-y with various flavor styles, Kelvin found that it covered up the taste of the fish a bit too much and was hard to rate. During their meal, they watched outside as Hawaiian cyborgs climbed up some nearby palm trees and rained giant leaves upon them. With the full party in tow, they then drove to the Honua’ula Forest Reserve to hike the Makahi O’oma Trail. The hike started off with greeting a group of chickens led by the cutest black piglet. Despite being warned by multiple online reviews, the group got slightly lost, blaming the complete lack of signage, as they wandered slightly too long through the meandering forest of Jurassic-looking trees and ferns. Still unsure of what happened, they managed to spit themselves out far downhill from where they started, but the long trek back was #worth since they saw a rainbow eucalyptus that they wouldn’t have passed otherwise. After saying goodbye to the piglet again (over an hour later!), they went into downtown Kona for dinner and dessert. A Kava bar piqued Joel’s curiosity, and the group ordered some “squid” lau lau and kalua, along with taro leaf-wrapped butterfish, which were all quite enjoyable. They ultimately didn’t order any kava kava after witnessing the shopkeeper mixing it with his fingers while describing its soul-cleansing and mildly psychoactive properties. After watching the sunset over the ocean, they got some gelato (lilikoi and Mauka trail - Kona coffee, chocolate, and macadamia nut - for Kelvin), then turned in for the night.

On Wednesday, the guys drove two hours to the Hilo side of the island. On the way, they stopped by Pine Tree Café, where Kelvin made the pro move of subbing fried rice with Portuguese sausage in his loco moco, making his own Hilo style that was nearly as good as Leilani’s! They also stopped by a fruit stand and got a fresh cold coconut for ten bucks. The shopkeeper cut it up with a machete before serving the coconut with a straw, and it turned out to be very pleasant. There was actually a lot of water, taking all three of the guys to finish it, and it tasted very fresh and light, unlike coconut water from the store. The meat was cut out after they finished drinking, which was a bit slimy but yummy too. At Waipio Valley Lookout, the group got a nice view of a korok forest, then they moved on to Akaka Falls, where they did a small circle hike. Per the fruit stand’s recommendation, they went into town for a farmer’s market, where they were introduced to lots of interesting fruits - huge avocados, candy apple bananas, apple mangos, grape tree, and a sprouted coconut! The shopkeeper asked if the coconut was for planting or eating, then hacked it up for them as well. They found a nearby sink to wash it in, then munched on it while browsing the rest of the stands. This coconut had a crunchy texture and subtle taste, which contrasted greatly with the younger version. After paying for their haul of fruit, the guys continued on to lunch at Tetsumen, where Kelvin ordered a curry ramen and a shirokuma, expecting cute bear-shaped shaved ice, but was disappointed by a random mound instead. In the afternoon, they went to Hawaii Tropical Botanical Gardens. Kelvin got swarmed by bugs and ended up with eight bites, though luckily they didn’t itch as much as the ones received at Yosemite. In the garden, there were lots of pretty wild orchids, as well as some huge mango trees that threatened to KO bypassers. From there, the group went to Liliuokalani Park and Gardens, where they chased some nene’s, and Rainbow Falls, before driving back to Kona. They picked up Amanda for dinner at an izakaya, then Kelvin, Shir, and Amanda played The Crew while Joel prepared a fruit omakase. Grape tree was quite sweet and enjoyable (except the seed), but candy apple banana was Kelvin’s favorite. There was also solid watermelon, though the mangos they picked up weren’t ripe yet.

Thursday started with more fruit in the morning, then the guys drove to Pololu Valley. They hiked down to the beach and skipped some rocks and found some large animal poops. In the town of Kohala, they browsed some local shops and a market with more interesting fruits such as eggfruit and chocolate sapote. Kelvin bought a vegan ice cream sandwich made of coconut gelato, mango, lilikoi, and pineapple. With more fruits in hand, they went back to the AirBnb to taste test - chocolate sapote had a nice jelly texture but not much taste 5/10, and star apple was quite good; Kelvin even liked the purple part that he wasn’t supposed to eat, 7/10. Amanda finished work early, and everyone went to Kenichi Bento for lunch, then picked up snacks to prepare for a sunset viewing atop Mauna Kea. They did a few small hikes along the mountain then chilled in the car munching on Maui onion chips and ume candy as the sun traveled under the horizon. A bit of stargazing later, they went back for their last night of rest on Kona.

On Friday morning, the four flew to Honolulu, getting jian bing for lunch and stocking up on some more snacks before checking in. They tried to coordinate with Stevelyn to visit the Pearl Harbor Memorial but got NACKed. It was just as hot on this island, and Kelvin took a nap between exhibits, then the group rode the tour boat across the bay to the USS Arizona and glimpsed a sea turtle under the water. For dinner, they met up with Mario, Max, and Natalie at Mud Hen Water and ordered the tasting menu, which had some very interesting fusion takes like mapo rice cakes and chicken long rice croquettes. They walked along Ala Wai by the river for a while, then upon returning to their AirBnB, Kelvin had to catch a gecko in a cup to save Amanda.

Everyone got up early the next day to get to Koko Head Café, a very popular breakfast spot, at opening time. Kelvin got the cornflake french toast with millennium bacon and shared some chicken dumplings with chipotle aiole. The group then drove to Windward O’ahu/Nu’uanu Pali Lookout, which had a gorgeous view over the city and the surrounding natural landmarks. They went to Ho’omaluia Botanical Gardens (another one), then Rainbow Crack Seed for some novel candies and Got Grindz for musubi. Steven picked up Kelvin and Joel later in the day, and they visited Mama Okai’s house, where they had a delicious homemade lilikoi cheesecake and chatted for a while. Kelvin discovered Steven’s childhood drawings and secret artistic talent, while Joel considered buying the neighboring plot to tend the bordering fruit trees as they admired Mama Okai’s garden. For dinner, everyone met up again at The Pig and The Lady, where they basically ordered one of everything. Kelvin especially enjoyed the ahi tataki toast and the pho 75 dac biet.

Finally, the most important day arrived - the gang made a quick visit to the aquarium in the morning and early afternoon, then got ready for Seorim and Daniel’s wedding. The ceremony was on the terrace of the Halekulani Hotel, and though humid af, they managed to avoid the rain. The food was delicious, and everyone enjoyed the whole carved kalua pig. After many cute speeches and veiled threats, the party concluded with photoboothing and a fireworks display! #planned. Kelvin missed out on an interesting afterparty but had to rest before a 12-hour flight back to NJ and a subsequent flight to Italy! #travel #wanderlust #hawhyi.
