## December 2, 2022 - December 4, 2022

The weekend after Thanksgiving, Esha and Kelvin decided to catch up with some old friends and explore some new restaurants in the city. On Friday, they went to RealReal for Esha to consign some clothing items while Kelvin chilled on the boyfriend couch. Esha was hoping that Kelvin would shop around the store on his own, but he hates happiness so Esha searched for items in his stead. In a stroke of luck, Esha found a brand new men’s Canada Goose with a black logo, which Kelvin had been eyeing earlier that week. The sizing was also perfect! With an additional 20% off the already discounted price, Kelvin felt that the deal was too good to pass up on, and added the new coat to his arsenal of rare RealReal finds.

Moving onwards to the actual reason they went to SoHo that day, Esha and Kelvin walked to Canada Goose for Esha to try on some coats for sizing while checking in with Danielle and Andrew where they wanted to meet for dinner. We eventually settled on Mercer Kitchen, but being a Friday night, they of course had no reservations available until 8:30pm at the earliest. In the meantime, the four of us got some orange wine and hung out at Danielle and Andrew’s apartment, while we talked about turning 30, AI art, pets, and HFT, among other things. When our reservation was almost ready, we walked over to Mercer Kitchen and sat at the bar for a bit while they got our table ready. Over the course of the night, Esha had a cocktail and some prosecco, in addition to the two glasses of orange wine she had from before. As expected, the conservation got wild, and we fantasized about all the things that could be if we were unapologetically young, shameless, and full of hope. Strangely enough, I think Danielle and Andrew are the only people I can really have this kind of conversation with. We also learned that Mercer Kitchen was the location where Jay-Z and Kanye recorded their collaborative album Watch The Throne, hence the restaurant’s popularity. The food itself was good, but nothing to write home about, and the service was extremely slow. Both Esha and Kelvin ordered pastas, while we got a plate of oysters to share. After a long night of catching up and conversations, we parted ways on a high note, hoping to meet up again soon in the new year.

On Sunday, Esha and Kelvin went to the city again, this time to find Kelvin a pair of gloves around Flatiron District. We first stopped by Willow for lunch, a new vegan restaurant that Kelvin found nearby. The restaurant has very cute decor, with many photographs and artwork of willow trees. We started off with the French onion soup, and in Esha’s opinion, it was the best French onion soup she has had in her life (drooling while writing this right now). For our mains, Esha ordered the “Scallop” Cacio e Pepe, which consisted of linguine, oyster mushrooms, and creamy “parmesan” sauce. Kelvin ordered the vegan interpretation of a Philly Cheesesteak, with seitan and oyster mushrooms on a toasted sub. Finally, we finished off with a vegan banana pudding, which was surprisingly creamy. It was also extremely banana-y, which Esha didn’t like but contrastingly made Kelvin a huge fan.

Afterwards, we walked off our large meal by going to multiple stores in search of winter gloves that actually fit Kelvin’s fingers. We eventually stopped by Muji, where Kelvin finally found a satisfactory pair of gloves. Being the Muji fanboy that he is, Kelvin was also drawn to the bean bag chair flash sale they were having. Kelvin had wanted to own a bean bag chair his whole life, and convinced Esha to sit on the chair on display. Esha, who was unable to get back up, realized that this was truly a necessary purchase. With much physical exertion, we managed to haul the bean bag chair, along with numerous other Muji purchases, all the way back to Jersey without too much commotion. We ended the busy weekend with ~~us~~ Bubbles chilling on the new bean bag in our living room.
