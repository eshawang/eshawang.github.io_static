On Saturday, E + K went on a morning run at Liberty State Park. Afterwards, we got lunch at Café Dolma in downtown JC, where we ordered Poached Eggs with Kiymali, Sautéed Spinach with Labneh, and Fingerling Za’atar Potatoes. We went to Trader Joe’s to stock up on ingredients and snacks, and later in the day, we got our delivery from Monterey’s Tasty Olive Bar, which E used to make a delicious arugula, avocado, and blueberry goat cheese salad.

On Sunday, we went to Chelsea Market and got Chicken & Sausage Jambalaya and Cream of Tomato with Chicken and Orzo soups and a California Melt from Hale and Hearty Soups for lunch.

Then, we went to see Porgy and Bess at the Met Opera, which we found quite stunning and surreal after seeing it in so many movies. We were so stunned that we didn’t make it to our seats in time for the show to start, and we had to watch the first scene of the first act from a screen. During that time, we realized we couldn’t understand any of the songs they were singing (uncultured af) and began to worry we would be sitting through 3.5 hours of gibberish. K pulled up the plot synopsis on Wikipedia, which helped, but when we reached our seats, we found that each one had a small screen that showed subtitles for the songs. This was a total game changer, and the rest of the opera was very enjoyable.

After the show, we met up with Irene, who was in town for a business trip, and tried to get a seat at Momofuku Noodle Bar. The line was too long, however, so we went to Donburiya instead, where we ordered Katsudon and California Don, along with some taro croquettes.
