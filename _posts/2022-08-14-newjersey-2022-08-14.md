## August 14, 2022

Esha and Kelvin’s sixth(?)(!) anniversary cook-off competition came a week late since Esha was supposed to visit Chicago; her flight there was canceled but they stayed in and stress-ate instead. Wait, that wasn’t that different from competition day. Anyway…

As usual, each person prepared a main dish, and Esha chose a dessert while Kelvin made the appetizer. This year, they introduced a scoring system so that the winner would be official(ish)! They would rate each dish out of 10 in categories of difficulty, presentation, and execution/taste, with the last category worth double for a total achievable score of 40.

The morning started bright and early with Esha preparing bread dough while Kelvin made a shopping trip to Costco for the freshest ingredients. It was a good thing that Esha started early, since the recipe she used had an incorrect conversion that caused her dough to be too hard and un-kneadable. The second time around she used more of her own judgment and it turned out much better. As Esha continued with the difficult baking work, Kelvin was first to prepare and present his appetizer - burrata salad with arugula, roasted cherry tomatoes, and pine nuts, served with toasted ciabatta topped with basil and cilantro. While Esha found the taste of the dish delightful, especially the tomatoes seasoned with vinaigrette, olive oil, and black pepper, Kelvin thought he could have done a better job with the plating and reduced the amount of liquid at the bottom of the salad. Score: 3.5 difficulty, 3.0 presentation, 7.5 execution = 21.5 points.

Esha’s main dish was a novel Hainanese chick’n, made of frozen tofu wrapped in tofu skin. The chick’n was cooked in green onion, ginger, and (real) chicken broth, slightly invalidating the vegan aspect but making it delicious, and served with garlic pulao, sliced cucumbers, sweet soy sauce, and a fried garlic ginger sauce. Esha’s care in the presentation of the dish shone through, and the immaculate combination of complex flavors and textures made this Kelvin’s favorite of the competition. Score: 6.0 difficulty, 9.0 presentation, 8.5 execution = 32 points.

Next up was this year’s most expensive dish, Kelvin’s $80 king crab legs, injected and cooked with garlic butter sauce and topped with fresh parsley. Kelvin bought a meat injector just for the occasion and had a lot of fun poking the joints to infuse the legs with buttery goodness. The meat was so voluminous and fresh and incredibly satisfying to dig out to eat. Just the sight of it made Esha drool; still, the dish itself was not terribly difficult to make, and Kelvin’s wallet was mostly responsible for the taste. Score: 4.5 difficulty, 5.0 presentation, 9.0 execution = 27.5 points.

Finally, the culmination of an entire day’s worth of mixing, kneading, rolling, and baking - Esha’s very own version of the orange ricotta sfogliatelle, which the two of them had been craving since their trip to Italy. Though made every so slightly easier with the use of a KitchenAid pasta maker, it was still an arduous task rolling and coating the many individual layers of the semolina “log”. The filling was made by mixing semolina flour, ricotta cheese, and candied orange bits, which Kelvin stole many tastes of throughout the day of cooking. Unfortunately, as Kelvin was helping to take them out of the oven, somehow the heat of the baking pan transferred through the oven mitts to his hands, and he dropped the pastries on the floor. Esha had to stop what she was doing to run to the pharmacy for vaseline, as he suffered second-degree burns on his fingertips. Kelvin had to run his hands under the faucet for over half an hour and developed blisters in between layers of skin, and there was a prickling sensation for a couple of days - overall, a 0.0 experience which he would heavily not recommend. The sfogliatelle, on the other hand, though suffering a few broken pieces, were still delicious and impressive looking, and Esha and Kelvin thoroughly enjoyed making their way through them over the course of the week. Score: 9.0 difficulty, 7.0 presentation, 6.5 execution (9.0 for filling, 4.0 for pastries) = 29.0 points.

Tallying up the scores, Esha was the clear winner of this year’s shokugeki, for handling the parallel preparation of two highly involved recipes and excelling over Kelvin at presentation. Kelvin suffered his loss graciously (his burns not so much), and was still able to make two very yummy dishes of his own. He’ll look for revenge next year, as well as buy a new set of oven mitts.
