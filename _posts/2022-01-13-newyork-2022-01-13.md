## January 13, 2022

Since K made the brilliant decision to get the both of us fake 'rona on his birthday, E had to reschedule our reservation at Keen's Steakhouse to Thursday night. Just two blocks from the 33rd Street PATH station, it was a quick trip on a chilly day. The restaurant decor was very interesting, with all the staff in black-tie and the walls adorned with photos and drawings of Abe Lincoln and old political cartoons. We were seated at our table with some delicious rolls and veggies with ranch dressing. K instantly knew what he wanted: the Legendary Mutton Chop, rare. And he convinced E to order the more expensive Dover Sole as well. E also got a lemon ginger cocktail, which K actually enjoyed (and couldn't even feel the alchohol in!).

Expecting a regular-sized cut of lamb for $60 at a famous restaurant like Keen's, K was absolutely bewildered when this giant piece of meat was placed in front of him.

Frantically searching through the Yelp reviews, we discovered that most people suggested the dish to be shared by two! Alas, E could not be of any help, yet K confidently announced, "I will do it!" The first bite into the mutton chop was like heaven, and K wanted to cry. The meat soaked in juices was so delicious, and the sweet minty jelly that was served alongside it created a refreshing contrast in flavor, texture, and temperature that ensured the dish never got boring, even nearly two hours later as K definitely showed signs of overburden. The previously consumed rolls and veggies became deep regrets, although the bok choy-like greens were still too good to pass up. E watched with great interest as K slowly traded his sanity and stomach capacity for more bloody goodness, as she had long ago finished her tasty, and reasonably-sized, fish and potatoes.

But finally, with much aplomb, K succeeded in eating two adults' worth of mutton chop!

In complete disbelief, we somehow arrived at the crazy decision to still order creme brulee for dessert. It came out with a candle for K's birthday, and K wished to not vomit later ( among other things). K had two bites and wisely left the rest for E. Stuffed and loopy, we walked off our dinner at Bryant Park, where there was a winter village and ice rink set up. E + K reminised and watched people struggle as the staff showed off in front of them. Finally, feeling surprisingly not that bad (the wish worked!), we went home to share our pics and laughter with friends and family. Just another increment in age, but a night and meal to remember :)
