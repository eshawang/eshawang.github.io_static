## January 2023

Esha and Kelvin went to the difficult-to-book Gramercy Tavern to celebrate Kelvin's birthday. Though they were still a bit sniffly from their post-Chicago colds, they looked forward to the famous cocktails and burger. The restaurant ambience was great, as they were seated at a cozy table near the lively bar and with direct LOS to the kitchen.

Esha started off with a fruity Izakaya cocktail, while Kelvin ordered the seasonal spritz. They indulged in accidental multiple flatbreads, which were all well-baked and flavorful.

For their entrées, Esha got the grilled black bass, and Kelvin of course sprung for the rare Tavern Burger, which was tasty but a bit overburnt on the sesame bun. Overall, they agreed that the food was about par, but the service and vibe were definite positives.

The evening ended happily, as their waiter brought out a coconut cupcake treat for Kelvin, who made a second birthday wish after already enjoying a delicious Torico ice cream cake earlier in the week.

Since they missed Janet and Lindsay during the holidays, Esha and Kelvin also took a short trip to Kansas City, which was strangely mostly located in Missouri, to meet up with them over MLK weekend.

Their first stop after landing had to be Joe's BBQ, where they stood in line smelling the meat for a while (a positive for everyone except Esha). They eventually got a table with their order of Z-Man and pulled pork sandwiches, alongside a full slab of pork ribs. Kansas definitely didn’t mess around with the slab size, as the four of them combined struggled to make it through all the meat. While the ribs were expertly smoked, they were not quite as flavorful as Texas BBQ, and the sandwiches were mid.

As the one meal was enough for Esha to be “meated out”, they checked in to their AirBnB near Union Hill and napped and Crew’ed for a few hours. By the time everyone was ready to head out again, it was already dark, but that allowed for a sweet view of the National WWI Memorial, which stood out like a beacon against the sky.

Their walk continued over and through Union Station, where they learned about the history of the USPS and the railroad, and into downtown KC.

Esha and Kelvin followed Janet to their first speakeasy, Swordfish Tom’s, a rustic establishment with a variety of interesting in-house cocktails and very knowledgeable server. Esha sprung for the Blank Verse, a tasty floral cocktail with four different types of alcohol (oops), and tried sips of Janet’s very smokey whiskey.

After finishing their sufficiently strong drinks, they had a dinner reservation at Novel, which Esha had worked very hard to secure a reservation for. Unfortunately, it happened to be Restaurant Week in KC, so they were offered a smaller, albeit cheaper, menu. Esha did not get to try the lobster ramen she had been looking forward to, but the four of them still enjoyed two meal sets with scallops, salmon and roe, and slices of fruit cake and pie for dessert.

On the walk back to the AirBnB, they passed through the Crown Center Square, which was still beautifully lit up with Christmas lights.

Sunday morning started at Succotash, where Esha and Kelvin ordered the vegan (kitchen) sink and Swedish pancakes. They really enjoyed the (actual) novel twists on breakfast dishes, especially the lima bean hummus and lingonberry crepes.

Energized for the day, they headed to the Kemper Museum of Contemporary Art, which was indeed contemporary and indeed art. Some notables were a “cat”, a “hen”, a spider that actually looked like a spider, and a depressed giant (along with Janet).

They continued on to the Nelson-Atkins Museum of Art, which was less contemporary and had eight giant badminton birdies on display, though their structural inaccuracies annoyed Lindsay.

There were some interesting paintings and sculptures throughout the museum, including lots of rectangles for Kelvin, but everyone enjoyed the walk around the outside lawn the most. They encountered totem poles, a cool mirror installation, and a glass maze that Kelvin trolled Esha through.

After finishing their rounds, the four of them drove to Country Club Plaza, a historic shopping area with Southern decor and cute penguin statues great for Instagram model shots.

They bought coffees and browsed a couple candy and clothing shops, then finally for dinner, they went to Corvino Supper Club. This was unanimously the best meal of the trip, as everyone enjoyed the variety and quality of interesting fusion dishes, though they could have gone without the live band’s rock rendition of Baby Shark. The chinese broccoli with whipped tofu and chili crunch was a hit appetizer, and Kelvin loved the Thai rigatoni bolognese. Esha’s favorite main was a gnocchi with roasted squash, and gingerbread affogato and olive oil lemon pavlova rounded off the menu.

On the last morning before flying out, the gang made a stop at Christopher Elbow Chocolates, where Esha and Kelvin drank delicious hazelnut hot cocoas and bought a bunch of truffles to go.

For lunch, they had gigantic “salads” at The Russell, and for second lunch, Janet went next door for a final BBQ sandwich from Gates BBQ while the rest of them looked on in amazement and slight disgust.

Back in NJ, Esha and Kelvin had a quiet week of B&B cuddles, Xi’an Famous Foods and Her Name is Han with Grace, and cat sitting Noodle for Wenqiu, until Kelvin got called for an impromptu company ski trip to Telluride, Colorado.
