## October 8, 2022 - October 11, 2022

Esha and Kelvin made a short SoCal trip out of their last wedding of the year. Flying into SD, Kelvin was literally bouncing in anticipation of their first meal at Lucha Libre. They got there right at opening time and ordered their usual Surfin’ Californias, which were as delicious as expected. The new salsa counter was a nice clean upgrade, though Esha’s favorite mango salsa was missing.

With some time to kill before their AirBnB check-in, Kelvin drove to Torrey Pines Beach, where they dipped their feet in the cool ocean and napped for a while.

After picking up a smoothie and juice from Earth Café, they then set out for Temecula. Kelvin zoomed a bit to maximize time for Esha to get ready, and though the heat and ants in the AirBnB made it difficult, they arrived at Jenny and David K.’s wedding at Fazeli Cellars in good fashion. Esha wore a pretty black dress with flower print, and Kelvin wore not khakis. They mostly chatted with Danielle and Andrew, fawning over Cici’s wedding outfit before the ceremony. The wedding screamed derp, as the flower girl was escorted down the aisle by two Rilakkuma bear onesies, and after Michael’s officiating over the vows, Jenny and David walked off to an “I Just Got Married” Lonely Island remix.

For the reception, to no one’s (real) surprise, there was boba for all the guests, though it was surprisingly good and cold for being catered from Riverside. At the dinner, Esha and Kelvin were seated at the TJ table with Danielle and Andrew, and they potentially made some new friends to play Overwatch with. After some fun dancing, taking a peek at Rex’s photobook, and cake and a decent number of drinks for Esha, they headed back to rest for the night.

The next morning, Esha and Kelvin drove to Irvine, where they stopped by the post-wedding barbeque. They chatted with Jenny about Japan and NYC while David entertained tennis people with tennis. After saying their good-byes, they then headed out to get lunch with Phoebe and Leon, who had come down from LA to see them, graciously bringing Magnolia Bakery too! Their original destination 101 Noodle Express unfortunately closed, so Kelvin never got to experience the hype, but they had a great time eating Szechuan food at Tasty Noodle House instead.

From there, everyone went over to Phoebe’s house to play with Toto, and they chatted a bit with Papa and Mama Ann too.

Esha and Kelvin’s last stop in Irvine was David P.’s apartment, where they finally got to meet Eunyce, Nari, and Ori. They sat on the couch for a long time, catching up on life, cats, and wedding stories, and eating banana pudding. Finally, as dinner time approached, Esha and Kelvin bid them well and set out for the last hour of their drive to SD. Despite not actually feeling hungry, when they passed by Oscar’s Seafood Tacos, Esha couldn’t resist turning in. Unfortunately again, the restaurant closed early, so they went down the street for a few slices of Bronx Pizza instead. They checked into their much more comfortable AirBnB, and settled down for the rest of the night with pizza and wedding chocolates in bed while watching Mean Girls.

Monday was SD tour day, which Esha and Kelvin started off with El Pescador in DTLJ. They got a clam chowder, Dungeness crab sandwich, and grilled sea bass sandwich to share. Everything was amazing as always, though the sea bass with a bit of hot sauce was the highlight for Kelvin.

From there, they walked to Bobboi Gelato, passing by a new contemporary art exhibit along the way. After finishing their scoops of Medditeraneo and Julian apple pie, they drove to the zoo, where they studied impressive upside-down bird nests, said hi to a turtle, and watched the elephants play. They were excited by the newly opened Africa Rocks exhibit, which had been under construction the last time they visited. Though Kelvin (supposedly) tried his best to find the koalas, they instead stumbled upon a super cute red panda that was excited for its dinner time.

As the zoo began closing, Esha and Kelvin rode the sky tram back to the entrance then finally got their long-awaited Oscar’s Seafood Tacos. They had kind of forgotten how delicious the shrimp and steak tacos were, and were thankful that they made room for it in their itinerary.

After dinner, they stopped by the renovated Hillcrest Extraordinary Desserts, picking up a slice of Ivoire Royale cake and a pumpkin pecan scone. Esha was very sad that both desserts were extraordinarily delicious, so that she had to help Kelvin eat them as they watched Ready Player One.

Their last meal in SD had to be Leilani’s Café, and they were super happy to see their new customization options for the Hilo style loco moco! Esha ordered one with teriyaki chicken, Kelvin got it with Kālua pork, and they added a dragonfruit lemonade and two orders of spam musubi. Though Paolo later confirmed their suspicions that the portions had gotten a bit smaller, it was yummy as ever and a great way to end their trip. Except of course on the way to the airport, they had to stop by Lucha and get another two burritos to eat the next day :).
