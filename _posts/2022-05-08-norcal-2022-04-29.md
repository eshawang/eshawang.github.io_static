## April 29, 2022 - May 8, 2022

At the end of April, K left his job at Bell Labs and began a month and a half of funemployment. Leaving his lovely gf and kitties behind, K flew into SFO (no direct flights to SJC wtf), where he was picked up by Dad and Mom, who graciously packed a delicious homemade meal that K instantly wolfed down. The first few days in Norcal were spent pretty chill, with a walk around Sandy Wool Lake with Mom, Sizzling Lunch and Somi Somi with Shirley + Derek, learning Wu Bie on piano, and more home-cooking.

On Sunday after dropping Derek off at the airport for his trip to Taiwan, the Fang fam went on a day trip to Sausalito. We had some yummy crab salad and lobster roll by the water at The Trident, then walked around downtown buying some unique colorful truffles and pastry desserts. We did a short hike to the west of the peninsula, then drove back into SF to wander around Stow Lake. K had never been there before and actually found it very pretty, and there were lots of cute animals including baby ducklings, turtles, and fish. For dinner, Dad swung us by a popular dim sum shop in Chinatown, where we got three delicious pork+veggie buns and a bunch of shumai and hargow for only 12 bucks.

While Dad and Shirley worked during the week, K fulfilled his IT duties fixing Mom’s computer’s random black screens and put together a recording of Wu Bie for Meev for Mother’s Day (YouTube link [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8h-4Cb5ETf0)). K got to try everyone’s new favorite restaurant Chef Liu, which had tons of different skewers in a special house seasoning, and he also discovered that Xian Kitchen had an amazing spicy dumpling soup, though the noodles were a bit of a disappointment this time due to a recent change in head chef. For real Mom, K bought a chestnut cake and multiple breads at Sheng Kee. On one evening walk, we saw some more ducks and rabbits around Lake Cunningham as well.

For the last weekend of K’s stay, the fam went to Yosemite together for the first time since K was in high school, though not much had changed apparently.

The first day had absolutely beautiful weather, with fantastic cloud formations lining the sky in every picture we took. The water levels were also quite high throughout the park, and we stopped by the rolling Merced River and Bridalveil Falls, where K got quite a nice shower (though small compared to what was to come!). K’s favorite part of the day was finding his old meditation spot in the Yosemite Valley field and taking a nap alone in the grass with the picturesque Yosemite Falls in front of him. We stopped by El Capitan, Swinging Bridge, and a few more outlooks, and then we headed to our stay at Yosemite View Lodge. We were initially horrified to find that our room was a complete mess of beer cans and dirty sheets, but we managed to argue our way to an upgrade, putting our patio right on the river! We still had to pay for WiFi though…

The second day, we parked in Curry Village and hiked out to Mirror Lake. During lunch, K had a small panic attack when he learned about the Covid requirements for entering the U.S., and he spent a few hours trying to hunt down accurate info and come up with a plan for E’s upcoming trip to Banff. After An Arduously Articulated Argument And Affront, K was eventually calmed down by E over the phone, and he and Dad decided to try and speedrun the Mist Trail before sunset. The hike up Vernal Falls was a super pretty and super wet one, with multiple rainbows on the way to the top. When we arrived at the last 0.3 miles though, the nearly straight ascent up was a bit more difficult than anticipated, and K had to take a number of breaks. However, with the power of sausage bread, he pushed through, and we got to enjoy a unique view of the very edge of the falls. On the way back down, we tried to motivate a few other struggling hikers, though the lady carrying her corgi did not seem to need much help. Eventually, we made it back to the village with a roundtrip time of just over 2 hours.

On K’s last day in Yosemite and Norcal, we passed by Sentinel Beach and The Ahwahnee Hotel before driving back down to Milpitas. We had to make a stop to oversee a tenant move out in Stockton, which gave K a mild Covid scare, but then enjoyed a delicious dinner of crawfish, crabs, and garlic noodles at Claw Shack. K packed up and said his goodbyes to M&M and continued on to FuNemployment part 2.
