## February 2023

February was a month of new cooking and new eats. Kelvin refined a tofu stew recipe with konjac and napa cabbage, and Esha recreated the miso sesame tofu they had liked from Her Name is Han.

They also tried Sugarfish in NYC, which had a (Nozawa) Trust Me sushi lunch set with no tipping. While the ponzu and chives seasoning lent some interesting flavors to the nigiri, they overall felt that the fish was not as tasty as Kazunori’s, nor as cheap.

At Breads Bakery, Esha and Kelvin picked up the usual chocolate babka, while also trying their Valentine’s special white heart dessert.

A desire to level up her interior decorating skills drew Esha into various furniture and flower shops, such as Design Within Reach, where Kelvin gawked at a $10k chair, Ariston Coffee Bar, which had a wide assortment of roses (and tasty coffee), and Avocado, where Esha looked at vases while Kelvin dubiously received a bundle of dried white daisies.

For actual Valentine’s Day, the two of them attended Dave’s cooking class and received ingredients to make their own beef/veggie bolognese pastas, toasted sourdough with ricotta and honey, and caramelized pear with granola. They had a lovely evening preparing their meal together while watching Gilmore Girls and sipping on wine and spritz. 

From the cooking class:

On the weekend, Esha and Kelvin tried Dirt Candy’s vegetarian tasting menu, though they weren’t able to book the Valentine’s special course this year. The novel beet éclair, savory onion chive pizza, and famous crispy butternut squash were highlights of the meal, but the other half of the menu was not too inspiring.

To fill Kelvin’s meat quota, they stopped by a skewer cart in Chinatown afterwards, where he munched on a deliciously seasoned lamb kebab, then searched frantically for his “lost” earmuffs, only to crack up insanely on the PATH train 30 minutes later when Esha pointed to them on his arm. At home, the two of them baked yummy nutella- and pistachio cream-filled muffins.

February was Esha’s turn for a business trip, and Kelvin drove them up to CT to try a seafood restaurant, Dog Watch Café in Stonington, recommended to them by Nathan. They enjoyed the bouillabaisse and fish and chips while watching a truly glorious east coast sunset on the water.

At the end of the week, Kelvin returned to pick her up and also to try the much raved about Chef Jiang, which turned out to be much better than its NYC namesake. Kelvin really liked the spicy cold dishes and squirrel fish, and Esha of course devoured a popcorn chicken and XLBs. Delicious-as-always CT ice cream from Frisbie’s Dairy Barn fueled Kelvin for the drive down to NJ.

More XLBs were had back home that weekend at Soup Dumpling Plus, along with a YOLO market price lobster crisp noodle.

That was followed up with pretty decor and even prettier matcha soft serve (in Kelvin’s opinion) at Matcha Cafe Maiko, to round out a great day of Fort Lee noms.

Finally, even B&B got some new eats this month, as Esha and Kelvin started experimenting with homemade cat food - the first batch of oven baked chicken breast, heart, and gizzard was a resounding success in their eyes (and mouths), which delighted their parents.

By Kelvin’s request, here are some bonus pics of Esha trying on Zimmermann outfits. By Esha’s decree, Kelvin is always wrong. (Honshu bathroom sign agrees!)
