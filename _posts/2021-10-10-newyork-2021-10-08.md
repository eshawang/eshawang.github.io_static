## October 8, 2021 - October 10, 2021

On Friday night, Phoebe and Leon came over to our apartment to stay the weekend. Phoebe and Leon are doctors in residency, and vacation days are hard to come by, so it was nice to see them after such a long time. That night, E presented Phoebe with her belated birthday gift - a baby pink robe. Phoebe loved it so much that she insisted on keeping both sizes small (for herself) and medium (for Leon), even though a large would have suited him much better. 

The next morning, E, Phoebe, and Leon (K was unfortunately on tapeout) met up with Danielle and Andrew for brunch at The Osprey in Dumbo. The restaurant was located inside a fancy hotel, and E thought the decor was fantastic. E ordered the Osprey Breakfast, which was surprisingly filling. E even gave her leftovers to Leon, who was still hungry after finishing his meal. Danielle and Andrew also brought their new puppy Cece, an adorable one-month old toy maltese, who obediently sat on Phoebe’s lap for most of the time.

Afterwards, Danielle and Andrew drove E, Phoebe, and Leon to their next appointment at the Museum of Ice Cream. Despite being a little late to the event, we were able to sufficiently stuff ourselves with ice cream and various desserts while being bombarded with pink walls and neon lights.

Leon was particularly excited to see a basketball hoop, and proceeded to have a dodgeball fight with Phoebe, while E took pictures of them the whole time.

After we finished exploring the museum, E took Phoebe and Leon to Bao Tea House (because we obviously weren’t full enough), and ordered some pork belly, fried chicken, and beef bao, along with a rose grapefruit tea for E. Even though we did not order too much, we all ended up incredibly full, which was not a great sign since Phoebe and Leon had dinner plans with another friend immediately after.

We then parted ways for the time being, and E headed over to Nyonya to have dinner with K, Steven, and Evelyn, who were staying in the city for a few weeks as well. We ordered the classic half Hainanese chicken (E’s favorite), roti canai, chow kueh teow, and chendol for dessert. Afterwards, E and K felt a bit tired and headed home, while Phoebe and Leon went to a comedy club in the city. When Phoebe and Leon got back, we all relaxed to a few episodes of The Dragon Prince before heading off to bed.

On Sunday morning, E, Phoebe, and Leon took the train to Chelsea Market, where E excitedly showed off her favorite places to eat. We started off with Los Tacos No. 1, where we ordered the adobada and pollo asado tacos. We all easily agreed that the adobada was probably the best tasting tacos we have ever had, despite Phoebe and Leon living in LA.

Afterwards, we stopped by Filaga Pizzeria, where we ordered a slice of the Bufalina and Mediterannea. Phoebe especially enjoyed the Bufalina, and was impressed by how fresh the mozzarella was. Meanwhile E and Leon’s favorite was the Mediterannea because of the unique toppings and overall blend of flavors.

We then stopped by Mokbar to order japchae dumplings and ho cake. Phoebe was pleasantly surprised with how tasty the japchae dumplings were, despite them being vegan. At our last stop, we went to The Lobster Place to order the lobster roll and clam chowder. Phoebe and Leon have not had too many lobster rolls in the past, so it was difficult for them to rank, but there was no doubt that the texture and flavor were superb.

To walk off some of the food we ate, we then did a little shopping in the area. We briefly stopped by Anthropologie just to gawk at the price tags, though there was an interesting display of a small forest made entirely from denim fabric.

We also stopped by a fragrance store called Sabon, where E bought a little bottle of perfume called White Tea. Finally, we did a little shopping at E and Phoebe’s one true love, Aritzia. E bought a sweater, while Phoebe tried on a few items and Leon went upstairs to take a nap on the couch. After our short excursion, it was time to eat again, and we were off to Chinatown to meet up with K and have dinner at Joe’s Shanghai. Luckily, we arrived slightly before the dinner rush, and we were able to get a table after only about twenty minutes of waiting. We started off ordering two stacks of crab and pork soup dumplings. E warned Phoebe that these dumplings were the best soup dumplings she has ever had and significantly tastier than Din Tai Fung’s. It seemed like Phoebe agreed, since she nearly requested to order two more stacks of soup dumplings! We decided to settle on one more instead. We also ordered some pork dumplings, green beans, and a chili oil fish dish, all of which were thoroughly delicious.

After we finished our meal, Phoebe pulled a sneaky trick on us, saying that she needed to go to the bathroom, but instead generously paid for our entire meal. All too soon, it was time for Phoebe and Leon to take their train back to Connecticut, where Leon’s parents resided. E and K walked them to their train station where we said our goodbyes, all the while being reminded that we have some pretty amazing friends.
