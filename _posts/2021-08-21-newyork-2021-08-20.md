## August 20, 2021 - August 21, 2021

Cissto visited us after seeing their family for the first time since the pandemic. E + K met them at Chelsea Market on Friday morning, where we kicked off our food tour with the standard Lobster Place picnic basket. We then swung through Filaga Pizzeria, Mok Bar, L’arte del Gelato, and finally braved the line at Los Tacos No. 1.

Afterwards, we toured Little Island, where we happened to catch a poetry reading by Rosamond S. King.

Our food tour continued through Greenwich’s Van Leeuwen’s until we arrived at Soho for some shopping. We went to the Aritzia where Team Jellicles was born, and E was finally allowed to go to Madewell at Ciss’s urging. We also completed a sidequest for shoes for Ciss at Steve Madden.

With the shopping haul done, we went up to K-Town for dinner at Samwon Garden. The food was delicious though a bit overpriced compared to Ulto’s experiences from Korea, and we embarrassed ourselves by letting the meat overcook a little.

After dinner, we went to Broadway Comedy Club for some good laughs about racism, camp counselors, and our sensitive millennial asses. Finally, we picked up Cissto’s luggage from their hotel in Times Square, snapping a picture of a WTFroto car for Alm along the way, and headed home. However, we got stuck waiting for the PATH for half an hour in the worst east coast summer humidity hell we had ever experienced, and the train wouldn’t even turn on their AC /anger.

At home, Cissto got to meet B&B, who immediately warmed up to them (their favorite humans so far)! Even though they were a little weirded out by Blossom’s quivering, they showered them with love, and Bubbles even cuddled with Ulto, further proving the Froto Equivalence Theorem. The next morning, K got up early to pick up breakfast from PBHbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbn (thanks Blossom), and E made a spread of XLB, cucumber salad, guac, and fried gluten. After eating and chilling a while with some TEA videos, we dropped Cissto off in Chatham for a family friend’s wedding. We stopped in Millburn on the way home for Gong Cha and strolled through nearby Taylor Park.
