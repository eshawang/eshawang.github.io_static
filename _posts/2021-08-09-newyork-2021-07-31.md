## July 31, 2021 - August 8, 2021

On Saturday morning, E + K went to Trader Joe’s to get some ingredients for watermelon + cucumber popsicles, which of course meant that we bought an extra two bags full of stuff (TJ’s OP). Then, we stopped by South Lions to pick up the best (and slowest) dim sum in JC, and K won the bet that it was actually ready this time. Somehow, winning the bet meant that K had to buy a lemon juice with ai-yu and white pearls from Gong Cha, but whatever. We took our dim sum order to Stevens Park and had a picnic on the grass while we enjoyed the nice weather.

Then on Tuesday, we went to Central Park after work to see Merry Wives (not Friends, E!) by Shakespeare in the Park. We were blown away by the quality of the show, acting, and props and thoroughly enjoyed the “remix” of the play, especially when K remembered he had actually read it before. Falstaff was the star of the show in K’s opinion, and Madams Page and Ford were consistently hilarious - can’t wait for the next season!

After the play, we checked 2G2G and picked up two boxes from Made in New York Pizza (which later turned to one after a strange NY subway interaction). We also stopped by Amorino for some blueberry cheesecake gelato and a yuzu pineapple sorbet drink (surprisingly good and not sour).

The next Sunday, we went back to Times Square to actually see Friends! The Musical Parody at The Theater Center. Beforehand, we had lunch at Silky Kitchen, where K enjoyed pork + pickled mustard greens (major nostalgia factor), though E found the noodles lackluster.

We stopped by Mia’s Brooklyn Bakery for slices of oreo, blueberry lemon, and apple cheesecake and also got a watermelon smoothie with cute complimentary watermelon tube from Gong Cha.

The musical was very funny, and the actor impersonations were spot on (especially Phoebe).
