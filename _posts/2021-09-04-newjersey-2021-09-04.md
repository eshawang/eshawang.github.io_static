## September 4, 2021

E + K were late with their anniversary cook-off this year, but we finally found a weekend to duke it out. As is tradition, our menu items were held secret until our shopping trip to 99 Ranch and Trader Joe’s. K was in a Thai mood and wanted to try some real deep frying with our new wok, so he made spring rolls with cabbage + carrots mix, Persian cucumbers, mint, green onion, cilantro, and vermicelli with homemade peanut sauce using peanut butter, sesame oil, soy sauce, rice vinegar, and honey and fried sea bream with six heads(!!) of garlic and turmeric (oh god the staining though). We used the leftover oil from deep frying for the next month :joy:.

E’s main dish was a soba noodle stir-fry with salmon, ginger, broccolini, and edamame. E also made some dango for dessert, inspired by Monster Hunter Rise. Unlike the traditional dango recipe, which uses only glutinous rice flour as a base, E also added some silken tofu into the mix to make the texture softer and a bit more chewy. Unfortunately, E could not find any strawberry powder at 99 Ranch, but ended up making some tasty sesame, milk, and matcha flavored dango.
