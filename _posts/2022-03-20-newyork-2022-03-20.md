## March 20, 2022

E + K went to the Bronx to visit the New York Botanical Garden and see The Orchid Show: Jeff Leatham’s Kaleidoscope. The morning drive was relatively easy as we crossed the George Washington Bridge for the first time. We started our visit walking through the Perennial Garden, which had several distinct “rooms” separated by yew hedges. They formed the forefront of the main attraction, the Haupt Conservatory. Stepping into the building, we were met with a sharp increase in humidity, turning E into an orchid, and the insta-worthy kaleidoscope art installment.

Throughout the rest of the conservatory, there were orchids and other plants from all kinds of biomes. K liked the ones that resembled Spanish dresses, and E found the upside-down hanging orchids amusing. There were also vines of thin vanilla seed pods and micro orchid clusters that looked like viruses. Between the rainforest and desert biomes, we walked through a rainbow tunnel that reminded us of Mario Kart.

After doing our (first) round through the conservatory, we went to Hudson Garden Grill for a relaxing lunch. We managed to beat the large lunch crowd and get a seat at a two person high-top table. E asked K to pick a cocktail for her, and he unknowingly ordered the one with three alcoholic ingredients, starting the meal off with a bang. We got a sunchoke soup to share, which included caramelized apples and hazelnuts, then E ordered the Senat Farms chicken breast, which was rotisserie-level juicy with perfectly crispy skin, and K the braised lamb ragu with mushrooms. For dessert, we ordered a lemongrass panna cotta that had a delicious ginger-basil syrup.

After lunch, we headed over to the Mertz Library, which was surrounded by a Daffodil Valley beginning to bloom. We watched one particularly round squirrel sniff its way through the field as we hiked along the trail and into the Thain Family Forest. After a while we rounded back to the conservatory again to sit in on an orchid care class, where we learned about epiphytic versus terrestrial plants and received some tips on improving humidity conditions for Buttercup back home. We were also able to help another cat + orchid owner to prevent teeth marks in their leaves!

For the rest of our afternoon, we walked along the tram path, sightseeing the reflecting pool with Rolex clock, Chilton Azalea Garden, Goldman Stone Mill, Edible Academy, and Magnolia Collection. We tried to catch a ride back to the main entrance but were passed by full trams, so we rewarded ourselves at the end with hot chocolate and a yuzu soda from the Pine Tree Cafe. We also stopped by the NYBG shop, where E happily procured a flowery hand cream and card for P’s upcoming wedding. K then got the true New York driving experience, taking double the time to get back home, while E took a nap.
