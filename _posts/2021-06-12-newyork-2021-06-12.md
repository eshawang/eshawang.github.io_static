E + K took the train to 14th street and got their first cronut ever from The Donut Pub.

Our original plan was to grab the usual staples from Chelsea Market (lobster roll from The Lobster Place, dumplings from Mokbar Korean Grub), but were enticed by a sign for ramen along the way. We decided life is too short to eat at a place more than once and spontaneously walked into Kogane Ramen, where we ordered Red Tonkotsu, Miso Lobster (there was so much lobster!), and a sake which turned out to be way too strong for E.

Then we walked around the L.E.A.F. Festival of Flowers in Chelsea. K liked the flower tunnel and the street sign displays. We also found Lucid Dreaming to recover our missing MP.

After grabbing some L’Arte del Gelato and japchae dumplings from Mokbar anyway (life is funny that way), we attempted to burn those calories walking all the way to SoHo and then Lower East Side. Along the way, we stopped to listen to a street band consisting of guitar and two old guys on bass and drums. 

At Pier 36, we watched the Immersive Van Gogh experience from all different angles (back against the wall, lying on the floor, and up the stairs). We had a good time looking at the merch and synesthesia chamber while thinking about Vox’s video on museum.

For dinner, we tried to get into Joe’s Shanghai but were too late, so we went to Tasty Hand-Pulled Noodles, where we had just enough cash to get some roast duck and shredded pork pan-fried noods.
