## March 2023

March marked the beginning of Esha’s new handbag saga, which involved many trips to Neiman Marcus at the Short Hills mall. For Kelvin, this meant trying more restaurants in the NJ suburbs, such as new Greek favorite Souvlaqueria and the only Mongolian BBQ in Northeast NJ, Magic Grill.

PJ and Vyas also came to stay in Brooklyn this month, and Esha and Kelvin got to see them a few times and catch up. On a Sunday morning, they endured some MTA struggles before arriving at Cheryl’s Global Soul for brunch. Kelvin ordered the buttermilk pancakes, which were fantastically fluffy, but he ultimately regretted not getting Esha’s cracked crispy fried chicken sandwich. Gotta remember that good shops can make fried chicken actually juicy…

After their meal, Esha and the three Lynbrook bros wandered around Prospect Park, then stopped by Doughnut Plant on the way up to Dumbo. They tried the peanut butter and strawberry jam yeast-raised donut, tres leches cake donut, and matcha green tea Wonder Wheel doughnut ice cream sandwich.

Needless to say, it was an excessive amount of sugar that even Kelvin struggled to finish, but they walked it off while taking pics of the Brooklyn Bridge and scoping out the roof of Time Out Market New York. Since PJ had to leave early for a party in Manhattan, he bought a quick burger from Pat LaFrieda, which Kelvin shared a bite of, then the remaining three of them got a low-key dinner at Saketumi Asian Bistro.

Esha rode a lot of trains in the following weeks, as she had to go to Hartford once more for work - at least this time, she got to see Phoebe and Leon while they were on vacation, and they ate delicious garlic bread and pasta at Salute together. She brought back some bread for Kelvin, who traded her his own homemade pesto chicken and pasta.

The next morning, the two of them rode Amtrak down to Washington, D.C. for their first east coast cherry blossom season. They shopped around the vendor tables in Union Station for a bit, then walked towards their AirBnB near Lincoln Park. The slight rain was rather comforting, and they found quite a few cherry trees, and the first of many duck couples, as they passed through Lower Senate Park.

After checking in, Esha and Kelvin did some quick sightseeing of the Capitol building, Library of Congress, and Supreme Court. They made their way up to Chinatown for lunch, ordering dim sum and popcorn chicken to go from China Boy, and stumbling upon the Washington Justice practice facility in search of boba.

With the optimal snack combo in hand, they waited in line for the National Archives Museum, next to an impressive parade of food trucks on Constitution Ave. More lines later, Esha and Kelvin finally got to see the Declaration of Independence, Bill of Rights, and Constitution, but they were completely illegible from fading. They GTFO’ed to Warner Theatre for the Cherry Blossom Festival opening ceremony, which was pretty cute and had a nice lineup of Japanese musical artists. Kelvin particularly enjoyed the marimbist Mika Stoltzman, and Travis Japan (and their fangirls) were entertaining to watch.

Sunday was sunnier, and the two of them walked down Independence Ave to the Washington Monument and National Mall. The blossom kite festival was in full swing there, and Esha and Kelvin spent a while hanging out under the cherry trees staring at the numerous kite designs and thinking about making a giant Vaatu. They eventually got up to see Floral Park and make their way around Tidal Basin, which was very pretty under the clear blue sky and inhabited by multiple additional duck couples. However, the area was so insanely crowded that Esha and Kelvin were often forced onto the muddy dirt paths, and after struggling through half of the loop, they decided to take a break for lunch.

They found an oyster bar on the wharf and experienced the slowest service of all time, taking two hours to get and pay for their meal of fried shrimp and kimchi fried rice.

At that point, they were apprehensive of returning to the cherry blossom crowd, so they headed north past Constitution Gardens to the White House lawn instead. Esha’s last request for their DC trip was another popcorn chicken, but on their way back to Chinatown, they ran into more random unpleasantness from cranky old bike lady and “Chris Rock”, who very understandably confused Kelvin for Bruce Lee (it was a compliment though!). They finally made it back to Union Station, where Kelvin celebrated his newfound stardom with a tiramisu milkshake from Shake Shack, and headed home from one of the trips of all time.

At least L’Artusi with PJ and Vyas was fun. Can’t beat that beet salad, and Bucatini Nero and hen of the woods Roasted Chicken were perfectly crafted. Olive oil cake finale made them wish they could have stayed longer!
