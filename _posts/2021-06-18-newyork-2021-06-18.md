## June 18, 2021

On Friday, E finished up a final presentation for her MCL project, and K had all his meetings canceled, so we went to the city for the afternoon. We stopped in at McNulty’s and got some Longjing tea leaves. K found a cute side street called 6-½th Street (like Platform 9-¾) with a French restaurant called Boucherie. E had the Loup de Mer en Papillote, and K ordered the Wagyu Bar Steak, and we shared a PJ Breeze cocktail.

After lunch, we visited MoMA’s sculpture garden and north wing.

E liked the display of words depicting cruelties against Native Americans.

K liked the room of rectangles.

And we were both thoroughly confused by the art(?) collection of museum furniture. 

After MoMA closed, we walked through Times Square to try out some huge cream puffs at Bibble and Sip. E got the black sesame while K got cookies and cream.

Then we ate at Joe’s House of Soup Dumplings, where we had the most mouth-watering crab and pork soup dumplings we’ve tasted (better than DTF!).

So much pain. But we finished everything!

We also stopped by 7 For All Mankind to look at jeans for K - he tried on a pair and almost bought them with alterations without looking at the price tag, then noped the f out of there...we probably can’t go back to that store anymore.

Later that weekend, we ate noodles and curry bao at Yasu in Jersey City and got strawberry shaved snow from Semicolon Café (we loved the decor and high loft there), then watched the waves for a while at the waterfront.
