## May 28, 2022 - May 31, 2022

May was a busy month for Esha and Kelvin, and the morning after we got back from Italy, we hosted Ciss, Ulto, and Cyvina, who were visiting from NorCal for the weekend. On Saturday morning, Kelvin drove to pick up our guests from the airport while Esha folded laundry and finished up cleaning. After our guests arrived, Esha made everyone some tea while Bubbles shamelessly drooled over Ulto’s presence (literally).

Ciss and Cyvina then took a nap on the couch, while Esha, Kelvin, and Ulto walked to Philippine Bread House to buy some adobo and pastries. After breakfast, the rest of us took turns taking naps until well into the afternoon. Esha and Kelvin brought Cyvina to the penthouse floor, where we saw the statue of liberty and a storm blowing over. After the storm had subsided, all of us took the train over to Chelsea Market, where we ordered the tried and true classics, including lobster rolls, adobada tacos, pizza, japchae dumplings, and korean fried chicken. We also got three bottles of watermelon lemonade, which was perfectly refreshing for the weather.

Afterwards, we walked the NYC High Line, where we found a meme of statue of liberty, observed tourists decapitating flowers, and imagined affording a nearby apartment.

Along the way, we sat down at a cute Italian cafe called Il Piccolo Ristoro, where we ordered some drinks and dessert. Kelvin instinctively said “grazie” on our way out.

We then decided to get even more dessert at Bibble and Sip, where Esha got a lychee berry and matcha sakura. We also stopped by Famous Original Ray’s so Cyvina could experience her first NYC style pizza. Along the way, we passed through utter chaos also known as Times Square, where we stopped for a few minutes to watch some guys break dance. We walked to Bryant Park to munch on all our acquired goodies, but it turned out everyone was still bloated from the food at Chelsea Market and the Italian cafe, so we just chilled and talked for a bit instead. At this point, we had already walked nearly 7 miles, so we collectively agreed to head home and rest our legs.

The next day, we continued our food tour with a meal at Nyonya. We ordered pork belly, Hainanese chicken (of course), seafood clay pot, and almost an extremely fishy noodle soup. The store owner eventually convinced Cyvina to order a different noodle soup after informing us that he can only remember two non-Malaysian people during his time working at the restaurant being able to handle it.

After lunch, we walked over to Washington Square Park where we sat on the grass and Esha got a skin allergy from something. We also stopped by several stores in SoHo, including Muji, Madewell, Aritzia, Steve Madden, and Uniqlo. Esha bought a long dress (with pockets!) from Madewell and we found the FFXIV cookbook at Uniqlo.

We were slowly making our way to Chinatown, but on the way, there was a hot sauce stand that immediately caught Kelvin’s eye, and after tasting a few, bought a few bottles to take home.

Eventually, we made it to Joe’s Shanghai at prime dinner time, but surprisingly we didn’t have to wait in line that long. We ordered the kong xin cai, twice cooked pork, General Tao’s chicken (wtfroko), and of course plenty of xiao long bao to go around.

On Monday, the entire crew took a short road trip to Connecticut, mostly since Esha was onboarding for her new job (!) the next day, but also to meet up with Boobu. We had hot pot at a restaurant in Wallingford called… Hot Pot. Despite the unimaginative name, the food tasted great, and we each got our own mini pot and customizable meat/veggie combo. Afterwards, we drove to UConn to get ice cream at Dairy Bar, which was extremely hyped by all of the UConn alums. This was Kelvin and Esha’s first time trying it, and was blown away by the creaminess of the ice cream. Apparently the school sources the milk directly from the cows roaming nearby (perks of historically being an agricultural school). Kelvin argues that the ice cream was some of the best he’s had, while Esha still thinks Van Leeuwen’s is slightly better and has more interesting flavors. We also learned the hard way that a single “scoop” is about the size of a small adult stomach, and made the mistake of ordering four scoops between the two of us.

After Kelvin finished all of his ice cream and half of Esha’s, we decided to take a stroll around campus to walk off the absurd amount of calories we had just eaten. It was almost sunset, and we got some nice golden hour views of the horizon. Esha and Cyvina had to viciously attack the swarms of bugs following us around, while the UConn natives led in front, completely unphased. At the end of the trail, Dream FC + Cyvina took a cute photo to commemorate our day.

Eventually, we said our goodbyes to Boobu and drove to the Hartford Marriott, where Esha would be staying for the week. After Esha settled in, she said her goodbyes to the rest of the crew, who drove back to Jersey for the night. 

For Cissto and Cyvina’s last day on the east coast, they went out to Flushing to meet up with Mama Ciss and get some delicious dim sum. The trip took a bit over an hour but was fairly straightforward, and the subway transfer at WTC was free. Popping out at Flushing Main Street, it seemed like they had been transported straight to a city in China surrounded by street food and boba stands. They took a bus to New Lake Pavilion, and Kelvin found out that Ciss was the exact splitting image of her mom. As the two chatted away in 100% Mandarin, with Kelvin trying to interject a sentence here and there but mostly keeping Ulto and Cyvina company, they worked through mountains of very authentic food, including giant shrimp, lobster, and fish dishes. The seafood was certified fresh by Ciss and Mama Ciss, who grew up in a fishing village in China, and certified delicious by Kelvin, who enjoyed eating.

After probably the most satisfying dim sum meal of Kelvin’s life, Mama Ciss dropped them back off near the train station, and they went into a hybrid boba-arcade game store called ParTea. Kelvin and Ulto tried a few claw games at Cyvina’s request, then they watched her roll gachas for her friend back home. With new collection of toys in hand, they made their way back to Jersey and to the airport, looking forward to the next time they could all hang out IRL.
