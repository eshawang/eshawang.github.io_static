## May 11, 2022 - May 16, 2022

E started her month long funemployment with a trip to Banff and to visit Alm and Petite who lived nearby. It was E’s first international trip since the pandemic started, and the flight was out of JFK, so E allocated plenty of time to get to the airport and to the gate. Luckily, there were no major issues! The view from the AirTrain was actually quite nice, despite it costing a hefty $8 each way.

E read several chapters of TGCF and took a short nap, which made the flight go by rather quickly. A few hours later, E landed at Calgary airport, where she was greeted by Alm and Petite. Afterwards, we drove to Red Deer (the Texas of Canada, as they call it), which was about an hour and a half drive away. Even though E landed at around 9pm Alberta time, the sun had barely begun to set, and we got a beautiful view of the horizon on the way to Alm and Petite’s apartment.

When we arrived at Red Deer, Alm and Petite warned E that Loki was a blabbermouth and mini Maeve was a feisty girl. E came prepared with Churu though. Loki instantly darted for the treats, while Maeve hesitated at first, but eventually gave in. That night, it seemed like both cats warmed up to E, since this is what she woke up to after losing the feeling in her legs.

The next morning, we woke up early to drive through Banff and north all the way to the Columbia Icefields, where we got to see the Athabasca Glaciers. We got the 11am off-peak tickets, which, to get to the viewpoint, consisted of riding a bus with some legit looking wheels through a steep and unpaved path. While the view was gorgeous, the glaciers were barely visible and significantly smaller than they were ten years ago (according to K), and E inevitably thought about humankind’s impending doom due to global warming. At this point, the only hint of the glaciers was a slight blue tint in the valleys between the mountains, and one had to squint to be able to see them.

The Icefield Adventure also included tickets for the skywalk, which was a glass bridge overlooking part of the mountain range in Jasper. On the way, E took more photos and even saw a couple of mountain goats!

It turns out Alm and Petite were both afraid of heights (mostly Alm), and had to muster some courage to walk over the glass bridge. E asked if they had seen Squid Game, and it was probably a good thing that they hadn’t.

Afterwards, we stopped by a gift shop where E tried on a kid-sized hat in the shape of a bear (why don’t they make these for adults?) and examined some dreamcatchers.

Food at the Icefield was overpriced and looked not particularly great, so we drove south instead to do some sightseeing. Unfortunately, Saskatchewan Crossing appeared to be completely frozen over, but we were able to do the short hike up to Sunwapta Falls.

On the way to the Airbnb, we went to Boston Pizza for dinner, which is also where Petite previously worked as a waitress. However, Boston isn’t exactly known for pizza and this was in Canmore of all places, so E’s intuition wasn’t wrong. We ended up getting 2-for-3 appetizers and a large pizza, which we did a pretty good job with, considering we hadn’t eaten the entire day!

The next morning, we woke up before sunrise to get in some golden hour photos for Alm and Petite, but it ended up being overcast anyway, so it didn’t actually matter. However, E did get some nice shots of elk. We first stopped by Lake Louise, but as with everything else, it was completely frozen over. Emerald Lake was only frozen over on one side, and we observed some duck jealousy and drama on the other.

Afterwards, we did a short but very slippery hike down Johnston Canyon, where there was a cave leading to a medium-sized waterfall. It was particularly crowded since University of Calgary students were apparently taking a field trip that day.

After our hike, we drove over to the Banff Upper Hot Spring to relax and recuperate our minimally mobile bodies. The hot spring itself actually looked more like a pool, and was crowded with people of all ages, including a teenage boy dressed in a bikini.

For lunch, we drove to downtown Banff, and E took Alm and Petite to their first ever “legit” ramen place. All things considered, it was actually pretty good by E’s standards. For sure better than Shitsengumi! We also stopped by a gift shop that sold Rocky Mountain air (for only 15CAD!!!) and a “Chicago-style” popcorn shop which was literally just a Garrett’s knockoff.

Later that evening, we rode the Banff Gondola up what felt like one of the highest peaks in Banff. Since this was around sunset, the view was absolutely gorgeous. At first, E wasn’t sure the Banff Gondola was worth the cost, but this experience definitely made her reconsider.

The next day, we decided to sleep in for once. For lunch, we drove back to downtown Banff, and E took Alm and Petite to their first Cajun experience! E and Alm both ordered a gumbo and jambalaya mix, while Petite ordered just the jambalaya. E also got some fried green tomatoes to share.

The rest of the day was spent mostly in the car, stopping at various places for sightseeing. We stopped by Lake Minnewanka, where Alm tried to go for a swim and regretted it immediately.

E’s favorite part of the day was Sundance Canyon trail, which was about 3 miles each way. The trail started off very flat, but rounded into a forest and then a canyon with a waterfall near the end. The backlight from the sun was perfect for portrait photography, so E snapped a few shots of Alm and Petite, including ones of them slapping each other.

The following day was E’s final full day in Canada, but since we needed to check out of the Airbnb in the morning and therefore lost access to the park pass (plus Alm and Petite were tired from yesterday’s strenuous hike), we decided to just drive back to Red Deer. We made a quick stop in Calgary for lunch, where E took Alm and Petite to their first actual JBBQ (not garlic potatoes) at Gyu-Kaku. E later found out that Calgary is apparently known for very good Taiwanese food, which E is resolved to try next time! For dinner, to save on costs, we went to the grocery store in Red Deer to buy some ingredients. E made some broccolini and her signature green onion pancake while Petite made chicken tenders. Though not exactly what E expected as a final meal, everything turned out to be quite delicious.

The next morning, E said goodbye to the kitties, and Alm and Petite drove E back to the airport. We said our goodbyes, and E encouraged them to visit NYC if they ever got a chance.
