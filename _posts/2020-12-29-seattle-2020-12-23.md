## December 23, 2020 - December 28, 2020

E + K landed in Seattle and drove to Mt. Rainier. We stayed in a small house in the forest with the best stocked fridge of any AirBnB. We were treated to smores, yogurt + granola, bagels, breakfast sandwiches, and more. 

The first day, we drove up Mt. Rainier, going on every trail we came across. We walked on a frozen river and ate icicles from under a bridge. We managed to drive all the way to the top of the mountain while seeing every open trail, which we thought was pretty impressive!

For dinner, we ate Ukrainian food from Paradise Village Restaurant, and hung out on a swinging bench.

On Christmas (aka E’s half-birthday) morning, we went back to Seattle, taking pictures along the Nisqually River and stopping by Alder Lake.

After settling into our AirBnB downtown, we relaxed with a stroll along the pier. Unsurprisingly, nothing was open except for Chinese food. We had some delicious dim sum and pork and curry hom bow from Mee Sum Pastry, which we ate while watching the seagulls at Pike Place. 

Saturday morning, we started with a hike around Discovery Park. There were some great views and many cute doggos. Then we visited Chihuly Garden and Glass.

For dinner, we dressed up for a fancy dinner at Altura (K got to wear his new Gucci coat).

E gets dressed up.

K loved the spiced chicken soup and lamb. E enjoyed the mushroom ragu and hot apple cider. E isn't used to eating rare lamb, but that day was an exception (though E still gave some to K since he seemed to enjoy it a lot more).

The day after, we went back to Pike place, stopping by World Spice Merchants to buy some honey orchid tea. For lunch we got the best salmon burger ever, which K “accidentally” ate 80% of (despite E’s blatant protests), from Seatown Market & FishFry.

We then perused the shops for a bit and stopped at Ellenos Real Greek Yogurt. Eventually, we headed back on the road to Snoqualmie Falls. E got some fabulous shots on her tripod, and we took the trail all the way down to the base of the falls. Walking alongside the river on the boardwalk was very soothing.

Then, K had a dark, snowy, and somewhat nervous drive to the Bavarian town of Leavenworth. The Christmas lights there, though, were amazing.

We also picked up the best German meal from Andreas Keller Restaurant. We ordered the Schnitzel Cordon Bleu, with Spätzle noodles, and traditional Bavarian potato salad (made with vinegar instead of mayo!).

On our last day in Washington, we went tubing at Leavenworth Ski Hill. The line was long, but we each got 3-4 runs, interrupted by some ramen and chili fries. We then drove to Lake Wenatchee, which was absolutely breathtaking. We spent a long time taking photos and taking in the pristine water and reflection of the horizon. K said the pictures don’t even do it justice, but E tried her best. 

On the way.

At night, we went back into town and passed by a family of deer casually hopping between people’s front yards. We explored all the shops, and K managed to get hot chocolate and the last cookie before Gingerbread Factory closed, while E waited in line for Stein. Unfortunately, the restaurant was a bit overhyped and significantly worse than the food from Andreas Keller. It also didn’t help that we somehow ended up ordering fries with fries with fries.

Finally, K + E fell into a deep potato-induced sleep and flew back to NJ the next morning to celebrate NYE. We had a great view of fireworks all over Jersey City from our apartment as we welcomed in 2021.
