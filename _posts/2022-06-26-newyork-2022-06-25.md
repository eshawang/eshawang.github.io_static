## June 25, 2022 - June 26, 2022

Kelvin flew back from his onboarding in Austin the night before Esha’s 29th birthday. As he continued his homework of reading TGCF on the plane, he was inspired to draw her a birthday card on his tablet. His neighbor asked if he was an art student, which was flattering both to his drawing ability and age, both undeservedly so. However, Esha really loved the card and showed it to her MXTX-obsessed friend(s). The two of them then spent the night sitting together and tidying up the apartment, catching up after nearly a month apart.

On the 25th, Esha took Kelvin(?) to KazuNori, a delicious and efficient (Kelvin’s favorite combination) handroll bar near Koreatown. They got there not quite at opening time, but still managed to beat the massive lunch crowd, which soon pushed the line out the door and down the block. Kelvin and Esha each enjoyed the full set menu, with Kelvin ordering the extra salmon hand roll by Esha’s demand since it was his first time there. The rolls were fresh and delicious and came out fast, with the toro being an obvious highlight followed by yellowtail (Esha’s new gateway into sashimi), and ending with a trifecta of shellfish rolls. At $24 for the 5-roll set (+$4 for the salmon) and tip included, Kelvin found KazuNori to be fantastic value and is super excited to go again.

After lunch, Esha wanted a drink to beat the heat, so they stopped by Biao Sugar, which they had passed by many times before but never tried yet. Esha ordered a summer special peach oolong, though her standard option of 30% sugar left the drink a little too watery. Kelvin got an ube brown sugar boba milk with pudding, which was much more sufficient just from the name alone. They collected their drinks from the intimidating tiger’s mouth, then headed over to (the world’s largest) Macy’s Herald Square for some shopping. Esha enjoyed perusing the 8(!!) floors of clothes and shoes while Kelvin was tickled by the antique escalators. Eventually, they exited the department store and continued on their way to Times Square.

Around 52nd Street, Esha’s eyes were drawn to a pistachio bombolone, and they made an impromptu stop at Angelina Bakery. Kelvin also bought an amaretto and tangerine gelato, which took them back to their recent trip to Italy. Finally, they walked over to Bibble & Sip, where Kelvin had ordered a whole cake version of Esha’s favorite dessert, the lychee berry piggy, from Gary the store owner. They easily collected the order and added a set of tea cakes (earl grey, matcha, and Thai tea flavored), a grapefruit honey Japanese panna cotta, and camellia green tea for good measure.

Back in Jersey, they made a quick trip to Trader Joe’s for some cooking ingredients and a succulent, which they dubbed Bojo-Jojo. While Esha set up her new terrarium gift from Janet and Lindsay, Kelvin made chicken shawarma wraps with spinach and feta fries for dinner. They enjoyed the meal while catching up on episodes of Spy x Family and The Boys.

The next day, both Kelvin and Esha did some work during the day, but they went out to Salt & Ginger for lunch, a new authentic Shanghai restaurant that came highly recommended by Boyu and Amy. They were temporarily embarrassed when the co-owner Kevin asked if they could use chopsticks since they ordered 100% in English, but that feeling was quickly forgotten once the food came out. The spread of pork hock, eggplant with string beans, and black bean popcorn chicken was perfectly cooked, and Kelvin and Esha relished in the satisfaction of finally having found a dependable source for Chinese cuisine in Jersey City. Coincidentally, after their first time trying Salt & Ginger, Boyu and Amy invited the two of them to join for dinner at a soft opening for their sister restaurant Red Feather NYC.

Kelvin and Esha made their way over to Greenwich Village and barely got in, as the co-owner Jerry was having a busy and successful night so far. Boyu and Amy were eventually recognized, and they were seated in front of a very cool phoenix logo. The group ordered quite a few appetizers, including seaweed chips, tofu and black fungus, and fried spring rolls. But as the main courses started coming out, everyone was treated to a surprise game of FPS simulator starting from Washington Square Park. Between waves one and two of incoming hysterical NPCs, the party was invited into the kitchen for a behind-the-scenes look at the operation, impressively run by just three staff members (including the head chef who was previously sous chef at a Michelin star restaurant). After peace and order were finally restored, Kelvin, Esha, Boyu, and Amy continued their meal of shrimp udon, bulgogi steak, and roasted chicken, while conversing with Jerry and Kevin (who had come over from Salt & Ginger on his own) and marveling at the nerves of steel possessed by restaurant workers. At the end of the night, they were given a generous friends’ discount for their dinner, but they made sure to tip very well for the borrowing of defensive barriers and offensive kitchen tools.

To end Esha’s birthday weekend on a lighter note, everyone made a final stop at Van Leeuwen’s to stock up on ice cream and try the new Big Face coffee affogato flavor. The caffeine was not needed to stay awake!
