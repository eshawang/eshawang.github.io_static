Kelvin made a brunch reservation at Blooming Hill Farm on Saturday, so he and Esha drove upstate for some delicious farm to table dining. The restaurant area was large and spacious, with tons of potted and hanging plants that Esha wanted to take home. They were seated at a small table by the window and knew immediately what they wanted to order. Kelvin got the Wagyu farm burger with cheddar, pickled onions, and garlic aioli, and he and Esha shared the Tomato Bomb pizza with tomato confit and scamorza cheese and the root veggie hash brown. Everything was made super fresh - Kelvin especially enjoyed the rareness of the beef patty, and Esha loved the sour cream served with the hash brown.

After “eating too much” again, they picked up a loaf of Balthazar sourdough and headed to the farmers market to peruse some fresh fruits and veggies. They got a nice haul of apples, mushrooms, carrots, and some cinnamon zucchini bread to boot. 

Though Kelvin got ghosted on his plan to visit Afternoon Acres, he salvaged the afternoon by taking Esha to Bear Mountain instead. Walking by many happy families and doggos, they arrived at Hessian Lake, where Esha’s eyes were drawn to a paddleboat rental. She was initially wary of getting her new boots wet, but Kelvin convinced her to go for it. After getting their life vests and boat, they paddled out to the middle of the lake; Esha benefitted a bit from Kelvin’s recent max resistance cycling workouts as her legs got tired. There, they took a break and enjoyed the scenery and autumn breeze.

When their time was up, they went by the lodge to get some drinks and snacks, though they had to wait behind a group of grown women buying copious amounts of stuffed animals for a gender reveal party…smh. They also stopped by a market stand, where Kelvin picked up two cans of yummy looking peach and cherry jam.

Finally, they made the drive back home, and Esha made a new recipe for a delicious vegan miso sesame udon with pea sprouts and shiitake. They wrapped up the day watching Blossom watch TV from bed.
