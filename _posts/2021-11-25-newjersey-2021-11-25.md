## November 25, 2021

E + K did some homecooking for Thanksgiving this year after grocery shopping the day before. We started a chicken broil in the slow cooker on Thanksgiving eve, then added tofu knots, black fungus, and shiitake mushrooms in the morning. For lunch, we finished some leftover mozzarella sandwich ingredients, tomato egg soup, and curry noodles, while we waited for the broil and prepped dinner ingredients. K made butternut squash soup and blueberry muffins (first time baker!), and E made turkey bacon-wrapped asparagus, roasted carrots, kale salad, and some overly spicy potatoes (E mistook cayenne pepper as paprika :p). While we cooked and ate our yummy meal, we watched old episodes of Glee!
