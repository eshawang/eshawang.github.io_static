## July 22, 2022 - July 24, 2022

Esha wanted Mango Mango Dessert to celebrate the end of another work week, so she and Kelvin took the PATH to Hoboken on Friday evening. As they strolled down Washington St., they made a couple of short stops. First, they were drawn into Carlo’s Bakery by a sign advertising lobster tails, which they discovered are what sfogliatelle are called in the U.S. These were filled with a creamy custard rather than orange ricotta, but Kelvin and Esha still enjoyed one alongside a chocolate strawberry cheesecake.

Two blocks further, they grabbed a small dinner at Mamoun’s Falafel consisting of falafel, hummus, and baba ganoush. They made it across the street to Sephora before closing time, where Esha did a return while also planning out her regimen for Kelvin’s facial treatment (inspired by his mom’s bday gift). Finally, they arrived at Mango Mango where they shared a refreshing mango juice with watermelon and rice ball.

When they returned home, Esha persuaded Kelvin to accept his spa treatment while he lied on the couch. Thus, he got his first experience with Glow Recipe's Watermelon Glow Hyaluronic Clay Pore-Tight Facial, Innisfree's Green Tea Cleansing Foam, SKII's Facial Treatment Essense, and Glow Recipe's Watermelon Glow Ultra-Fine Mist. Though he couldn’t stop laughing at first, Kelvin eventually relaxed to the scent of honeycrisp apple candle, Esha’s superb neck massage, and Cateen’s piano concert playing in the background. With a glowing visage, he then fired up the stream to play the new game Stray, but his spotlight was quickly stolen by B&B #catswatchingstray ([https://www.twitch.tv/videos/1540110682](https://www.twitch.tv/videos/1540110682)).

On Saturday, after both working through the morning, Kelvin paid Esha back for the facial by dragging her with him to the gym (you’re welcome Nathan). They worked out for an hour, until Esha got noodle arms, then they made a trip to TJ’s. With their grocery shopping completed, Kelvin set to work trying out a new muhammara recipe they found while Esha prepped their homemade pizza. They happily devoured their meal as they watched the last season of Peaky Blinders, then Esha asked if Kelvin could make the My FFXIV Party meme for Team Jellicles. Kelvin pulled up some adventurer plates and attempted to copy them in detail, but both he and Esha found it to be a bit difficult. They temporarily gave up the notion after struggling to draw Garr and went to bed with some kitty cuddles.

The next morning, Kelvin found some artistic inspiration and started again on the drawing with a simpler style. He quickly found his flow and soldiered through all eight portraits over the span of a few hours, as Esha provided supporting commentary and prepared lunch. Together, they filled out the quotes and descriptions of Team Jellicles, then shared the meme to Dream, laughing uncontrollably as their teammates witnessed their likenesses.

With that task finished, they set out for Broadway to finally see The Phantom of the Opera, which Kelvin had been waiting 14 years for. Their seats were in the rear orchestra at the Majestic Theatre, and from the start, the stage effects were flashy (literally) and incredible. The boat scene in particular was breathtaking, and the music throughout was so powerful and emotional. Esha didn’t know anything about the plot beforehand and found the ending quite sad, and Kelvin, who had seen the movie many times, was impressed how good the character getup and acting in the real musical were.

Since the show started at 5pm, they walked over to dinner afterwards, continuing their vegan streak with Beyond Sushi. They ordered the gua bao, charred avocado maki roll, shiitake truffle dumplings, and nori taco sampler. Everything was super flavorful, especially the sampler of spicy jackfruit “crab”, sriracha “zalmon”, and yuzu infused “tuna”, which somehow all had the consistency of actual seafood.

After dinner, Kelvin and Esha made a quick stop at NY Bakery & Desserts for some strawberry tres leches and white chocolate mousse cake, and a free cake pop to boot. They ended a packed and productive weekend relaxing back at home watching videos of Phantom and making up songs about B&B :)
