## July 3, 2021 - July 5, 2021

For the July 4th weekend, E + K planned a nice, naturey getaway to the Poconos. On Saturday morning, K grabbed breakfast from Philippine Bread House, and E happily woke up to the sight of lumpia, pork adobo, and sausage with eggs. After sufficiently stuffing ourselves, we hit the road to Jim Thorpe. Though the weather could not seem to make up its mind along the way, the temperature ended up perfect (at least for E) in the lower to mid-60s.

After a brief orientation where we learned about basic safety procedures and that everyone hates New Jersey, we took a short shuttle (actually a school bus) to the rafting boats. E and K were paired up with an older couple D and L. D was actually somewhat of a pro, having rafted about five other times previously. E and L had never rafted before, and K only once (and he fell out of the boat), so we were all very appreciative of D’s callouts to avoid getting stuck on the rocks.

Sometime along the way, it started pouring, but we didn’t mind since we were all wet anyway, especially K who jumped into the water (on his own this time) for a swim. Rain or shine, the view of the river and surrounding area was magnificent.

We even paddled through a narrow tunnel, where we saw a mama duck with her wet baby ducklings huddled around her.

Around the halfway point, we parked our boats to eat the included BBQ buffet lunch, which consisted of hot dogs, potato salad, chips, and apples. K managed to eat four hot dogs, while E gorged on three servings of potato salad. While we ate, rain started to pour again, but even soggy potato chips tasted delicious considering how hungry we were from rafting. With cramped arms and some very tired backs, we paddled the rest of the way to the shuttle buses, which took us back to camp. We then drove to our AirBnB in Weissport, where we were met with some very outgoing housemates playing 7 Wonders. For dinner, we walked to The (hidden) Gorge, where we ordered truffle tater tots (so fluffy!), a pork schnitzel for K, and shrimp tacos for E. E also ordered a mojito, which was surprisingly pink and, of course, way too strong.

After a nice, warm shower, we fell asleep to A Mystery of a Hansom Cab on Prime Video, and tried to recover our noodle arms with some much-needed rest.

The next morning, we drove to the Poconos biking site at Lehigh Gorge State Park, where we pregamed with leftover Phillipine Bread House. A shuttle took us to the trailhead, where we were fitted for bikes; the workers took one look at K’s short legs and passed him a kid-size bike, meanwhile E got the tallest bike they had. The full Lehigh Gorge trail from White Haven to Jim Thorpe was 25 miles long, and we made several stops along the way. Around the 5 mile mark, we stopped by a pretty waterfall and took a lot of wide angle shots on E’s phone.

A bit later, we found a nice dock to sit on, where we relaxed and enjoyed the view of the river.

After 20 miles, E and K were definitely feeling the burn in their legs, and E suffered a bug in her eye while K fought a constantly-declining bike seat. However, we managed to power through and were rewarded with some fantastic shots of the river from the bridges past Glen Onoko.

After returning our bikes, and with noodle legs to match our arms, we nearly collapsed into our seats for dinner at Moya Restaurant. We happily devoured sauteed mushrooms, crab fusilli, and honey barbecue pork roast.

Feeling satisfied and full, we packed up our things and drove back to NJ for a great view of the fireworks from our apartment.

On Monday, we decided to go to Flip Sigi in West Village for some Cali burritos that E had been craving all week (month) long. To our surprise, we discovered that Mondays were BOGO burritos!

After that, we stopped by Van Leeuwen again for some ice cream, this time ordering honeycomb (again) and earl grey.

E had to return something at Aritzia, but we used this opportunity to relax at the store with some much needed AC. In the meantime, K spontaneously organized an FFXIV ultimate group, which was met with quite a bit of enthusiasm. E eventually managed to drag K to Zara to get some not-gray T-shirts and sweaters for when colder weather comes up. Surprisingly, K was very happy with his purchases - now, only pants, shorts, and belts to go! For dinner we managed to get into Joe’s Shanghai with a relatively reasonable wait time of 20 minutes at 5pm. We ordered the crab and pork soup dumplings, which were much better value than Joe’s Home of Soup Dumplings, though the quality control was not quite as good. Two of the eight dumplings leaked without even being touched, but they were delicious nonetheless. We also ordered a fish head stew, which was way too big for the two of us to finish (if only we were still 25), but very authentic!
