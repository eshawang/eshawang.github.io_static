For E’s birthday, K planned an evening out in Greenwich Village. Right off the 9th street station, we visited Té Company for a box of Pineapple Linzer cookies before our dinner reservation at Pinto Garden. K did something embarrassing once again and was punished by E ordering bomba rice for two (actually a delicious Tom Yum seafood paella).

E also got a Lychee Bellini, and K enjoyed a Lamb Massamun curry, along with fresh rolls with spicy peanut dressing.

The setting was beautiful, with flowers and fairy lights in an open-roof shed outdoors behind the restaurant. After dinner, we got mango lassi and honeycomb ice cream from Van Leeuwen, then waddled around West Village and Washington Square Park. We ended the night at Mezzrow, where we listened to Luke Carlos O’Reilly perform jazz and soul piano with upright bass and drums. It was really nice to sit down and hear live music for the first time in over a year, and both the band and the crowd had a wonderful time.

Funny highlights from the show included the band missing a drum solo, the drummer being told which key to play in, and taking credit for Norwegian Wood from The Beatles. Also, K double fisted grapefruit juice and rose lemonade soda - super manly.

Finally, we got back home and K surprised E with a newly polished Triforce.
