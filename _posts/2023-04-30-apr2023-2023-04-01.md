## April 2023

Esha and Kelvin found out through the powers of “SFbruhs” that Julian and Yukari had been living in NJ/NY for the past two years. Flabbergasted, they all met up in midtown for lunch at Barn Joo and caught up over a delicious sake flight and way too much Korean food. They talked about work post-PhD, B&B(&B), and asked Yukari for recs for Esha and Kelvin’s upcoming Japan trip.

After packing up and fighting over who would take the leftovers, they went over to Macy’s for some shopping. The department store had its annual Flower Show on display, with elaborate themed backdrops and outfits in its windows. Among the many shops and decor on the ground floor, the Miss Dior Rose Harvest stood out, and they had a fun time smelling all the different perfumes interspersed between rose bushes. Esha was won over by the simple but classic J’adore Eau de Parfum, which she later bought from Sephora.

They continued up and down the rest of the floors, looking at some jeans and a cute top from Ralph Lauren, but ultimately not succeeding in lowering any bank accounts. After parting ways with Julian and Yukari, Esha and Kelvin headed south through Madison and Union Square Parks. They stopped by the Harry Potter store since Kelvin was in the middle of Hogwarts Legacy and had fun comparing the characters’ wands/chopsticks. There was even a dungeon-like basement with a spiral staircase that reminded them of the headmaster’s office.

They skipped the butterbeer this time due to calorie concerns and were almost tempted again by Max Brenner around the corner, but the two of them held strong. They made it all the way south of Chinatown to their target Michaeli Bakery, where they bought a chocolate babka for comparison with Breads and a classic alfajores package for good measure. Although the snacks were for them to take home, Esha and Kelvin’s appetites were whetted, and they were intrigued by a tofu store Fong On a few blocks over. They enjoyed a tofu dessert with boba, red bean, and taro balls that was right up Kelvin’s alley and a bottle of the best soy milk they had had in the states.

Afterwards, they went to SJFZ (yes it’s an acronym now) for dumplings and new steamed buns! Everything was delicious as always, and they went home stuffed and PTFO’ed. 

A week later, Kelvin suffered a really bad stomach bug, and Esha had to drive him to the ER in the middle of the night. After he recovered, and inspired by Fong On, Esha began home-making soy milk to replace his dairy intake. It was hard work filtering out the milk from the blended soybeans, but the end result was quite tasty, and the process resulted in some bonus goodies of tofu skin and soy bean paste pancakes (made with veggies and cilantro-chili oil)!

To replenish the many lost nutrients, Kelvin also instigated an impromptu weekday night Chinatown trip. He satisfied his Taiwanese food craving with chicken leg and pork chop rice bowls from May Wah Fast Food and discovered Esha’s new favorite boba shop One Cup Tea, where they enjoyed a watermelon yakult drink and popcorn chicken.

Since they were in the area, they swung by SJFZ again for some frozen pork and cabbage dumplings to take home; sadly, they had just run out of frozen buns. Back at the apartment, Esha wanted to watch The Devil Wears Prada, and Kelvin never says no to a movie with Anne Hathaway. There was a surprising lack of Prada though, and the boyfriend was a loser. 

Before heading to Japan, there were a few more food appointments for Esha and Kelvin to make. Kelvin wanted to try Prince&I, a hole-in-the-wall Thai fusion restaurant in downtown JC, which they walked to on a Friday evening. It featured healthy and very Instagrammable dishes like crab cake crepe and chicken rice bowl not pad thai, as well as yummy red bean bingsu drinks.

Later that weekend, they also enjoyed a meal with Esha’s co-worker Muhtasham, who was visiting from Munich. They went to Saray Cuisine in Cliffside Park, which apparently has a large Turkish community, and had their first experience with some more authentic dishes such as iskender with two types of eggplant appetizers and lebni. Accompanied by Turkish teas, it was a very flavorful and filling dinner, though not quite up to Muhtasham’s native standards. Afterwards, they had breads and sweets (rice pudding, trileche, and baklava) from the nearby sister bakery as they discussed ASICs, NLP, and Muhtasham’s plans in America.

Back in NYC, Esha and Kelvin did a cheap eats food tour starting from Los Tacos No. 1 and passing through SoHo for the usual RealReal and Muji stops. They realized they had missed Joe’s Pizza, so Kelvin pointed them towards Nolita Pizza instead, which had a comparatively crispier crust and very clean taste.

At One Cup Tea, Esha ordered her same combo, while Kelvin got a peach oolong tea with lychee jelly and Taiwanese sausage, and with the third trip being the charm, they finally got their hands on frozen buns from SJFZ (25 for only $11)!

Mrs. Maisel new season binge and a nice dinner date at Willow before Katherine and Chichi’s housewarming brought the two of them to their much anticipated vacation, which simultaneously felt like it had crept up on them out of nowhere - time really flies these days…

Also they received the cutest and most accurate B&B keychains from Cyvina :3
