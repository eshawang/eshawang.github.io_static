## December 12, 2021

E + K went to the city on Sunday intending to do some Sephora returns and to look for gifts for the Arch-Meev (and of course, food!). Unfortunately, we forgot the returns at home, so we did not visit E's favorite place. But we still had a surprisingly productive day in NYC. Our first stop as usual was Los Tacos No. 1, where we each got two adobada tacos and a horchata to share. E went very hard on the toppings, and K got to try the red salsa this time. After whetting our appetites, we walked to Balthazar bakery in Soho to look for baguette heros for homemade sandwiches, but we found that they were only for wholesale. From there, we decided to go to Ladurée, though we stopped first at Dr. Martens for E to find her combat boot size. At Ladurée, we got a gift box of macarons for Arch-Meev, since it wasn't something we thought could be easily found in AZ, and a rose croissant for ourselves (which was yummy but could have had more rose flavor in our opinion).

Since we weren't able to get a drink and sit down, we also tried out Matchaful, where we chilled for a while looking at FFXIV job memes and sipping Hojicha Latte and Secret Garden.

On the way back, we passed by a giant A, which we initially laughed at and sent to the Dream discord. But upon seeing the inside of the pasta bar and noticing truffle (aaaaa) on the menu, we stepped inside for dinner. We ordered the $100 pasta sampler, consisting of five half-dishes for two, and were blown away by the food. First came the Tonnarelli Cacio E Pepe (black pepper) and Tagliatelle Al Tartufo Nero (truffle aaaaa), which were perfectly complemented by the Rigatoni All 'Arrabbiata (spicy tomato), and E + K were already in carb + umami heaven. There was so much generous truffle flavor, and the perfect bounciness of the pasta combined with plating/presentation set this restaurant far apart from previous Italian places we had tried. We looked like savages fighting each other over soaking up the remaining sauces with bread. When we thought the food couldn't get any better, out came the Tortelli Mantovani Di Zucca (pumpkin/pear/lemon zest/nutmeg/butter/sage!!). This was the most unique dish of the night, and E + K agreed that A deserved a Michelin star for this dish. We could taste every ingredient/flavor without any of them overpowering the others, and it was so delicious even with E dying from fullness. Finally, to end the meal and night, we got the 24K Gold Spaghetti (squid ink/sea urchin), which drew looks from the neighboring tables. While the squid ink was on the salty side by itself, when combined with the uni and amazingly juicy tomato, it became absolutely perfect.

Satisfied and somewhat delirious, we made the much-needed walk back to WTC while marveling at how we keep randomly stumbling on such amazing food experiences with so little effort :drool:
