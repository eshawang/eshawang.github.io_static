After the end of a busy work week, Esha wanted to get out of the apartment for a bit, so Kelvin found a restaurant in The Heights called Ozu which had pretty good reviews. When we arrived, we were surprised that the place was very hole-in-the-wall, and had a total of only five seats. Luckily, there was a group before us who were just finishing up, so we got seated rather quickly.

We started with the curried cauliflower & Asian pear, which came out piping hot and delicious. Notes were taken on how we could improve our own homemade curry cauliflower soup. Next, we ordered the popular Ozu ramen as well as the beef bento. The ramen tasted very unique. The broth was clear and mostly shoyu-based, while the pork was thick-cut and crispy on the outside. The beef bento included a soba side, which Kelvin was very pleased about, as well as some mystery veggies that tasted somewhere in between a potato and yam. Lastly came the okonomiyaki, which was thicccc. At this point, we had already ordered way too much food, and only managed to eat two small slices before packing the rest to go. Overall, very solid experience and we are super excited to order from Ozu again.
