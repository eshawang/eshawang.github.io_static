## November 20, 2021

E + K went to the Christian Dior: Designer of Dreams exhibit at the Brooklyn museum. On the way, we stopped by Los Tacos No. 1 for two adobada tacos and a horchata. We got the tacos loaded with everything, and K even used all three salsas - we then proceeded to discuss those tacos for the entire walk to The Real Real for returns. At noon, we met up with Danielle + Andrew at Vinegar Hill House, which had some very unique takes on breakfast foods. K ordered a large sourdough blueberry pancake, which reminded E of a burnt cheesecake, and E got a very fluffy omelette that K thought had a very interesting texture on the inside.

After walking Danielle + Andrew and their new tiny puppy C back to their apartment, we headed to the museum. We learned a lot about the history of Dior, and the fashion world in general, such as the fact that YSL succeeded Dior at the age of only 21. The displays were quite well done, especially the collections of works by all the heads of Dior throughout the couture's history. It was very interesting seeing the design trends over time, though K's favorite was still the dress with the lion's head.

After the museum, we got dinner at a Laotian restaurant called Khe-yo, though this was one of the more lackluster meals we have had in NYC.

For the rest of the evening, we did some heavy TEA prog, clearing Wormhole and seeing J-waves for the first time. Then we watched Last Night in Soho, just a tad late for Halloween. It ended up being a lot less scary than expected, though the cinematography was great, and E actually watched most of the movie without a blanket over her eyes, while K got away with just telling the TV “No” one time.
